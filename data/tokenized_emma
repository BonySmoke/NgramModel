chapter i [END]
emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home [END]
and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings [END]
of existence and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world [END]
with very little to distress or vex her [END]
she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate [END]
indulgent father and had in consequence of her sister's marriage [END]
been mistress of his house from a very early period [END]
her mother [END]
had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct [END]
remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied [END]
by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short [END]
of a mother in affection [END]
sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr woodhouse's family [END]
less as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters [END]
but particularly of emma [END]
between _them_ it was more the intimacy [END]
of sisters [END]
even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal [END]
office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed [END]
her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being [END]
now long passed away they had been living together as friend and [END]
friend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked [END]
highly esteeming miss taylor's judgment but directed chiefly by [END]
her own [END]
the real evils indeed of emma's situation were the power of having [END]
rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little [END]
too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened [END]
alloy to her many enjoyments [END]
the danger however was at present [END]
so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes [END]
with her [END]
sorrow came a gentle sorrow but not at all in the shape of any [END]
disagreeable consciousness miss taylor married [END]
it was miss [END]
taylor's loss which first brought grief [END]
it was on the wedding-day [END]
of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought [END]
of any continuance [END]
the wedding over and the bride-people gone [END]
her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect [END]
of a third to cheer a long evening [END]
her father composed himself [END]
to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit [END]
and think of what she had lost [END]
the event had every promise of happiness for her friend [END]
mr weston [END]
was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age [END]
and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering [END]
with what self-denying generous friendship she had always wished [END]
and promoted the match but it was a black morning's work for her [END]
the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day [END]
she recalled her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen [END]
years how she had taught and how she had played with her from five [END]
years old how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse [END]
her in health and how nursed her through the various illnesses [END]
of childhood [END]
a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the [END]
intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect [END]
unreserve which had soon followed isabella's marriage on their [END]
being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection [END]
she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent [END]
well-informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family [END]
interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself [END]
in every pleasure every scheme of hers one to whom she could speak [END]
every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her [END]
as could never find fault [END]
how was she to bear the change it was true that her friend was [END]
going only half a mile from them but emma was aware that great must [END]
be the difference between a mrs weston only half a mile from them [END]
and a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages [END]
natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering [END]
from intellectual solitude [END]
she dearly loved her father but he [END]
was no companion for her [END]
he could not meet her in conversation [END]
rational or playful [END]
the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr woodhouse had [END]
not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits [END]
for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity [END]
of mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years [END]
and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart [END]
and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him [END]
at any time [END]
her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony [END]
being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond [END]
her daily reach and many a long october and november evening must [END]
be struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next [END]
visit from isabella and her husband and their little children [END]
to fill the house and give her pleasant society again [END]
highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town [END]
to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies [END]
and name did really belong afforded her no equals [END]
the woodhouses [END]
were first in consequence there [END]
all looked up to them [END]
she had [END]
many acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil [END]
but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss [END]
taylor for even half a day [END]
it was a melancholy change and emma [END]
could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things [END]
till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful [END]
his spirits required support [END]
he was a nervous man easily depressed [END]
fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them [END]
hating change of every kind [END]
matrimony as the origin of change [END]
was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled [END]
to his own daughter's marrying nor could ever speak of her but [END]
with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection [END]
when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from [END]
his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to [END]
suppose that other people could feel differently from himself [END]
he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad [END]
a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal [END]
happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield [END]
emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him [END]
from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him [END]
not to say exactly as he had said at dinner [END]
poor miss taylor i wish she were here again [END]
what a pity it [END]
is that mr weston ever thought of her [END]
i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot [END]
mr weston is such [END]
a good-humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves [END]
a good wife and you would not have had miss taylor live with us [END]
for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own [END]
a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own [END]
this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours [END]
my dear [END]
how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see [END]
us we shall be always meeting [END]
_we_ must begin we must go and pay [END]
wedding visit very soon [END]
my dear how am i to get so far [END]
randalls is such a distance [END]
i could not walk half so far [END]
no papa nobody thought of your walking [END]
we must go in the carriage [END]
to be sure [END]
the carriage [END]
but james will not like to put the horses to for [END]
such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we [END]
are paying our visit [END]
they are to be put into mr weston's stable papa [END]
you know we [END]
have settled all that already [END]
we talked it all over with mr weston [END]
last night [END]
and as for james you may be very sure he will always like [END]
going to randalls because of his daughter's being housemaid there [END]
i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else [END]
that was [END]
your doing papa [END]
you got hannah that good place [END]
nobody thought [END]
of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you [END]
i am very glad i did think of her [END]
it was very lucky for i would [END]
not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account [END]
and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil [END]
pretty-spoken girl i have a great opinion of her [END]
whenever i see her [END]
she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner [END]
and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she [END]
always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it [END]
i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great [END]
comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is [END]
used to see [END]
whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know [END]
she will be hearing of us [END]
he will be able to tell her how we [END]
all are [END]
emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas [END]
and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably [END]
through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own [END]
the backgammon-table was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards [END]
walked in and made it unnecessary [END]
mr knightley a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty was not [END]
only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly [END]
connected with it as the elder brother of isabella's husband [END]
he lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor [END]
and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual [END]
as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london [END]
he had [END]
returned to a late dinner after some days' absence and now walked [END]
up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square [END]
it was a happy circumstance and animated mr woodhouse for some time [END]
mr knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good [END]
and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were [END]
answered most satisfactorily [END]
when this was over mr woodhouse [END]
gratefully observed it is very kind of you mr knightley to come [END]
out at this late hour to call upon us [END]
i am afraid you must have [END]
had a shocking walk [END]
not at all sir [END]
it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild [END]
that i must draw back from your great fire [END]
but you must have found it very damp and dirty [END]
i wish you may [END]
not catch cold [END]
dirty sir [END]
look at my shoes [END]
not a speck on them [END]
well [END]
that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal [END]
of rain here [END]
it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour [END]
while we were at breakfast [END]
i wanted them to put off the wedding [END]
by the bye i have not wished you joy [END]
being pretty well aware [END]
of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry [END]
with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well [END]
how did you all behave [END]
who cried most [END]
ah [END]
poor miss taylor [END]
'tis a sad business [END]
poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly [END]
say poor miss taylor ' [END]
i have a great regard for you and emma [END]
but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at [END]
any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two [END]
especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature [END]
said emma playfully [END]
that is what you have in your head [END]
i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by [END]
i believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr woodhouse [END]
with a sigh [END]
i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome [END]
my dearest papa [END]
you do not think i could mean _you_ or suppose [END]
mr knightley to mean _you_ [END]
what a horrible idea [END]
oh no [END]
i meant [END]
only myself [END]
mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know [END]
in a joke it is all a joke [END]
we always say what we like to one another [END]
mr knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see [END]
faults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them [END]
and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself [END]
she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would [END]
not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being [END]
thought perfect by every body [END]
emma knows i never flatter her said mr knightley but i [END]
meant no reflection on any body [END]
miss taylor has been used [END]
to have two persons to please she will now have but one [END]
the chances are that she must be a gainer [END]
well said emma willing to let it pass you want to hear [END]
about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all [END]
behaved charmingly [END]
every body was punctual every body in their [END]
best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen [END]
oh no [END]
we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart [END]
and were sure of meeting every day [END]
dear emma bears every thing so well said her father [END]
but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor [END]
and i am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for [END]
emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles [END]
it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion [END]
said mr knightley [END]
we should not like her so well as we do sir [END]
if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to [END]
miss taylor's advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be [END]
at miss taylor's time of life to be settled in a home of her own [END]
and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision [END]
and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure [END]
every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily [END]
married [END]
and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma [END]
and a very considerable one that i made the match myself [END]
i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place [END]
and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would [END]
never marry again may comfort me for any thing [END]
mr knightley shook his head at her [END]
her father fondly replied [END]
ah [END]
my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things [END]
for whatever you say always comes to pass [END]
pray do not make any [END]
more matches [END]
i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed [END]
for other people [END]
it is the greatest amusement in the world [END]
and [END]
after such success you know every body said that mr weston would [END]
never marry again [END]
oh dear no [END]
mr weston who had been a widower [END]
so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife [END]
so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his [END]
friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful [END]
mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did [END]
not like it [END]
oh no [END]
mr weston certainly would never marry again [END]
some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed [END]
and others of the son and the uncle not letting him [END]
all manner [END]
of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none [END]
of it [END]
ever since the day about four years ago that miss taylor and i [END]
met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle [END]
he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas [END]
for us from farmer mitchell's i made up my mind on the subject [END]
i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed [END]
me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave [END]
off match-making [END]
i do not understand what you mean by success ' said mr knightley [END]
success supposes endeavour [END]
your time has been properly and [END]
delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four [END]
years to bring about this marriage [END]
a worthy employment for a young [END]
lady's mind [END]
but if which i rather imagine your making the match [END]
as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself [END]
one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor [END]
if mr weston were to marry her ' and saying it again to yourself [END]
every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success [END]
where [END]
is your merit [END]
what are you proud of [END]
you made a lucky guess [END]
and _that_ is all that can be said [END]
and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess [END]
i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky [END]
guess is never merely luck [END]
there is always some talent in it [END]
and as to my poor word success ' which you quarrel with i do not [END]
know that i am so entirely without any claim to it [END]
you have drawn [END]
two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something [END]
between the do-nothing and the do-all [END]
if i had not promoted mr weston's [END]
visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed [END]
many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all [END]
i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that [END]
a straightforward open-hearted man like weston and a rational [END]
unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their [END]
own concerns [END]
you are more likely to have done harm to yourself [END]
than good to them by interference [END]
emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others [END]
rejoined mr woodhouse understanding but in part [END]
but my dear [END]
pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up [END]
one's family circle grievously [END]
only one more papa only for mr elton [END]
poor mr elton [END]
you [END]
like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him [END]
there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been [END]
here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably [END]
that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought [END]
when he was joining their hands to-day he looked so very much as if [END]
he would like to have the same kind office done for him [END]
i think [END]
very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing [END]
him a service [END]
mr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very [END]
good young man and i have a great regard for him [END]
but if you [END]
want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come [END]
and dine with us some day [END]
that will be a much better thing [END]
i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him [END]
with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time said mr knightley [END]
laughing and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much [END]
better thing [END]
invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best [END]
of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife [END]
depend upon it a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care [END]
of himself [END]
chapter ii [END]
mr weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family [END]
which for the last two or three generations had been rising into [END]
gentility and property [END]
he had received a good education but [END]
on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become [END]
indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers [END]
were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social [END]
temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied [END]
captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances [END]
of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill [END]
of a great yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love [END]
with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife [END]
who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance [END]
which the connexion would offend [END]
miss churchill however being of age and with the full command [END]
of her fortune though her fortune bore no proportion to the [END]
family-estate was not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it [END]
took place to the infinite mortification of mr and mrs churchill [END]
who threw her off with due decorum [END]
it was an unsuitable connexion [END]
and did not produce much happiness [END]
mrs weston ought to have found [END]
more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper [END]
made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness [END]
of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit [END]
she had not the best [END]
she had resolution enough to pursue [END]
her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain [END]
from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger [END]
nor from missing the luxuries of her former home [END]
they lived beyond [END]
their income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe [END]
she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once [END]
to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe [END]
captain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills [END]
as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst [END]
of the bargain for when his wife died after a three years' marriage [END]
he was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain [END]
from the expense of the child however he was soon relieved [END]
the boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering [END]
illness of his mother's been the means of a sort of reconciliation [END]
and mr and mrs churchill having no children of their own [END]
nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to [END]
take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease [END]
some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed [END]
to have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations [END]
the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills [END]
and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to [END]
improve as he could [END]
a complete change of life became desirable [END]
he quitted the militia [END]
and engaged in trade having brothers already established in a [END]
good way in london which afforded him a favourable opening [END]
it was a concern which brought just employment enough [END]
he had still [END]
a small house in highbury where most of his leisure days were spent [END]
and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society [END]
the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away [END]
he had by that time realised an easy competence enough to secure [END]
the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had [END]
always longed for enough to marry a woman as portionless even [END]
as miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own [END]
friendly and social disposition [END]
it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence [END]
his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth [END]
on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling [END]
till he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long [END]
looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects [END]
in view till they were accomplished [END]
he had made his fortune [END]
bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new [END]
period of existence with every probability of greater happiness [END]
than in any yet passed through [END]
he had never been an unhappy man [END]
his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage [END]
but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly [END]
amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof [END]
of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen [END]
to excite gratitude than to feel it [END]
he had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was [END]
his own for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought [END]
up as his uncle's heir it had become so avowed an adoption [END]
as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age [END]
it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his [END]
father's assistance [END]
his father had no apprehension of it [END]
the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely [END]
but it was not in mr weston's nature to imagine that any caprice [END]
could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed [END]
so deservedly dear [END]
he saw his son every year in london [END]
and was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine [END]
young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too [END]
he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his [END]
merits and prospects a kind of common concern [END]
mr frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively [END]
curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little [END]
returned that he had never been there in his life [END]
his coming [END]
to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved [END]
now upon his father's marriage it was very generally proposed [END]
as a most proper attention that the visit should take place [END]
there was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when [END]
mrs perry drank tea with mrs and miss bates or when mrs and [END]
miss bates returned the visit [END]
now was the time for mr frank [END]
churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was [END]
understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion [END]
for a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention [END]
of the handsome letter mrs weston had received [END]
i suppose you [END]
have heard of the handsome letter mr frank churchill has written [END]
to mrs weston [END]
i understand it was a very handsome letter indeed [END]
mr woodhouse told me of it [END]
mr woodhouse saw the letter and he [END]
says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life [END]
it was indeed a highly prized letter [END]
mrs weston had of course [END]
formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing [END]
attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense [END]
and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression [END]
of congratulation which her marriage had already secured [END]
she felt [END]
herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough [END]
to know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only [END]
regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship [END]
for her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her [END]
she knew that at times she must be missed and could not think [END]
without pain of emma's losing a single pleasure or suffering [END]
an hour's ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear [END]
emma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation [END]
than most girls would have been and had sense and energy [END]
and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily [END]
through its little difficulties and privations [END]
and then there was [END]
such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield [END]
so convenient for even solitary female walking and in mr weston's [END]
disposition and circumstances which would make the approaching [END]
season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the [END]
week together [END]
her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude [END]
to mrs weston and of moments only of regret and her [END]
satisfaction her more than satisfaction her cheerful enjoyment [END]
was so just and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father [END]
was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity [END]
poor miss taylor ' when they left her at randalls in the centre [END]
of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening [END]
attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own [END]
but never did she go without mr woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh [END]
and saying ah poor miss taylor [END]
she would be very glad to stay [END]
there was no recovering miss taylor nor much likelihood of [END]
ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation [END]
to mr woodhouse [END]
the compliments of his neighbours were over [END]
he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event [END]
and the wedding-cake which had been a great distress to him [END]
was all eat up [END]
his own stomach could bear nothing rich and he [END]
could never believe other people to be different from himself [END]
what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body [END]
and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having [END]
any wedding-cake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly [END]
tried to prevent any body's eating it [END]
he had been at the pains [END]
of consulting mr perry the apothecary on the subject [END]
mr perry [END]
was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one [END]
of the comforts of mr woodhouse's life and upon being applied to [END]
he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the [END]
bias of inclination that wedding-cake might certainly disagree [END]
with many perhaps with most people unless taken moderately [END]
with such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr woodhouse hoped [END]
to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the [END]
cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till [END]
it was all gone [END]
there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys [END]
being seen with a slice of mrs weston's wedding-cake in their [END]
hands but mr woodhouse would never believe it [END]
chapter iii [END]
mr woodhouse was fond of society in his own way [END]
he liked very much [END]
to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes [END]
from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature [END]
from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the [END]
visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked [END]
he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle [END]
his horror of late hours and large dinner-parties made him unfit [END]
for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms [END]
fortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish [END]
and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr knightley [END]
comprehended many such [END]
not unfrequently through emma's persuasion [END]
he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening [END]
parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any [END]
time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week [END]
in which emma could not make up a card-table for him [END]
real long-standing regard brought the westons and mr knightley [END]
and by mr elton a young man living alone without liking it [END]
the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude [END]
for the elegancies and society of mr woodhouse's drawing-room [END]
and the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being [END]
thrown away [END]
after these came a second set among the most come-at-able [END]
of whom were mrs and miss bates and mrs goddard three ladies [END]
almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield [END]
and who were fetched and carried home so often that mr woodhouse [END]
thought it no hardship for either james or the horses [END]
had it [END]
taken place only once a year it would have been a grievance [END]
mrs bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a [END]
very old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille [END]
she lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was [END]
considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady [END]
under such untoward circumstances can excite [END]
her daughter enjoyed [END]
a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young [END]
handsome rich nor married [END]
miss bates stood in the very worst [END]
predicament in the world for having much of the public favour [END]
and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself [END]
or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect [END]
she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness [END]
her youth [END]
had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted [END]
to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small [END]
income go as far as possible [END]
and yet she was a happy woman [END]
and a woman whom no one named without good-will [END]
it was her own [END]
universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders [END]
she loved every body was interested in every body's happiness [END]
quicksighted to every body's merits thought herself a most fortunate [END]
creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother [END]
and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted [END]
for nothing [END]
the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature [END]
her contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body [END]
and a mine of felicity to herself [END]
she was a great talker upon [END]
little matters which exactly suited mr woodhouse full of trivial [END]
communications and harmless gossip [END]
mrs goddard was the mistress of a school not of a seminary [END]
or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of [END]
refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality [END]
upon new principles and new systems and where young ladies for [END]
enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity but [END]
a real honest old-fashioned boarding-school where a reasonable [END]
quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price [END]
and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble [END]
themselves into a little education without any danger of coming [END]
back prodigies [END]
mrs goddard's school was in high repute and [END]
very deservedly for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy [END]
spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty [END]
of wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer [END]
and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands [END]
it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked [END]
after her to church [END]
she was a plain motherly kind of woman [END]
who had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled [END]
to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit and having formerly [END]
owed much to mr woodhouse's kindness felt his particular claim [END]
on her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancy-work [END]
whenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside [END]
these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently [END]
able to collect and happy was she for her father's sake [END]
in the power though as far as she was herself concerned [END]
it was no remedy for the absence of mrs weston [END]
she was delighted [END]
to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with [END]
herself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings [END]
of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent [END]
was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated [END]
as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close [END]
of the present day a note was brought from mrs goddard requesting [END]
in most respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her [END]
a most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen [END]
whom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in [END]
on account of her beauty [END]
a very gracious invitation was returned [END]
and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion [END]
harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody [END]
somebody had [END]
placed her several years back at mrs goddard's school [END]
and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar [END]
to that of parlour-boarder [END]
this was all that was generally known [END]
of her history [END]
she had no visible friends but what had been [END]
acquired at highbury and was now just returned from a long visit [END]
in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her [END]
she was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort [END]
which emma particularly admired [END]
she was short plump and fair [END]
with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features [END]
and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening [END]
emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite [END]
determined to continue the acquaintance [END]
she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith's [END]
conversation but she found her altogether very engaging not [END]
inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing [END]
shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly [END]
grateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly [END]
impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style [END]
to what she had been used to that she must have good sense [END]
and deserve encouragement [END]
encouragement should be given [END]
those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be [END]
wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions [END]
the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her [END]
the friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort [END]
of people must be doing her harm [END]
they were a family of the name [END]
of martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large farm [END]
of mr knightley and residing in the parish of donwell very creditably [END]
she believed she knew mr knightley thought highly of them but they [END]
must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates [END]
of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance [END]
to be quite perfect [END]
_she_ would notice her she would improve her [END]
she would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her [END]
into good society she would form her opinions and her manners [END]
it would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking [END]
highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers [END]
she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking [END]
and listening and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens that [END]
the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the supper-table [END]
which always closed such parties and for which she had been [END]
used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready [END]
and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware [END]
with an [END]
alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never [END]
indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively [END]
with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas [END]
did she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend [END]
the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she [END]
knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests [END]
upon such occasions poor mr woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare [END]
he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion [END]
of his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome [END]
made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his [END]
hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing [END]
his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat [END]
such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that [END]
he could with thorough self-approbation recommend though he [END]
might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing [END]
the nicer things to say [END]
mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs [END]
an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome [END]
serle understands boiling [END]
an egg better than any body [END]
i would not recommend an egg boiled [END]
by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small [END]
you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you [END]
miss bates [END]
let emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart a _very_ little bit [END]
ours are all apple-tarts [END]
you need not be afraid of unwholesome [END]
preserves here [END]
i do not advise the custard [END]
mrs goddard what say [END]
you to _half_ a glass of wine [END]
a _small_ half-glass put into a tumbler [END]
of water [END]
i do not think it could disagree with you [END]
emma allowed her father to talk but supplied her visitors in [END]
a much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had [END]
particular pleasure in sending them away happy [END]
the happiness [END]
of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions [END]
miss woodhouse [END]
was so great a personage in highbury that the prospect of the [END]
introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble [END]
grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings [END]
delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated [END]
her all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last [END]
chapter iv [END]
harriet smith's intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing [END]
quick and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging [END]
and telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased [END]
so did their satisfaction in each other [END]
as a walking companion [END]
emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her [END]
in that respect mrs weston's loss had been important [END]
her father [END]
never went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground [END]
sufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied [END]
and since mrs weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined [END]
she had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not pleasant [END]
and a harriet smith therefore one whom she could summon at any [END]
time to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges [END]
but in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her [END]
and was confirmed in all her kind designs [END]
harriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile [END]
grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring [END]
to be guided by any one she looked up to [END]
her early attachment [END]
to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company [END]
and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that [END]
there was no want of taste though strength of understanding must [END]
not be expected [END]
altogether she was quite convinced of harriet [END]
smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted exactly the [END]
something which her home required [END]
such a friend as mrs weston [END]
was out of the question [END]
two such could never be granted [END]
two such she did not want [END]
it was quite a different sort of thing [END]
a sentiment distinct and independent [END]
mrs weston was the object [END]
of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem [END]
harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful [END]
for mrs weston there was nothing to be done for harriet every thing [END]
her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who [END]
were the parents but harriet could not tell [END]
she was ready to tell [END]
every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain [END]
emma was obliged to fancy what she liked but she could never [END]
believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered [END]
the truth [END]
harriet had no penetration [END]
she had been satisfied [END]
to hear and believe just what mrs goddard chose to tell her [END]
and looked no farther [END]
mrs goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the [END]
school in general formed naturally a great part of the conversation and [END]
but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey-mill farm [END]
it must have been the whole [END]
but the martins occupied her thoughts [END]
a good deal she had spent two very happy months with them [END]
and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe [END]
the many comforts and wonders of the place [END]
emma encouraged her [END]
talkativeness amused by such a picture of another set of beings [END]
and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much [END]
exultation of mrs martin's having _two_ parlours two very good parlours [END]
indeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddard's drawing-room [END]
and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years [END]
with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys [END]
and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed [END]
and of mrs martin's saying as she was so fond of it it should be [END]
called _her_ cow and of their having a very handsome summer-house [END]
in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink [END]
tea a very handsome summer-house large enough to hold a dozen people [END]
for some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate cause [END]
but as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose [END]
she had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and daughter [END]
a son and son's wife who all lived together but when it appeared [END]
that the mr martin who bore a part in the narrative and was always [END]
mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something [END]
or other was a single man that there was no young mrs martin [END]
no wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little [END]
friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she [END]
were not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever [END]
with this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number [END]
and meaning and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr martin [END]
and there was evidently no dislike to it [END]
harriet was very ready [END]
to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry [END]
evening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured [END]
and obliging [END]
he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring [END]
her some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them [END]
and in every thing else he was so very obliging [END]
he had his [END]
shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her [END]
she was very fond of singing [END]
he could sing a little himself [END]
she believed he was very clever and understood every thing [END]
he had a very fine flock and while she was with them [END]
he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country [END]
she believed every body spoke well of him [END]
his mother and sisters [END]
were very fond of him [END]
mrs martin had told her one day and there [END]
was a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body [END]
to be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married [END]
he would make a good husband [END]
not that she _wanted_ him to marry [END]
she was in no hurry at all [END]
well done mrs [END]
martin [END]
thought emma [END]
you know what you are about [END]
and when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send [END]
mrs goddard a beautiful goose the finest goose mrs goddard had [END]
ever seen [END]
mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all [END]
the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson [END]
to sup with her [END]
mr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line [END]
of his own business [END]
he does not read [END]
oh yes that is no i do not know but i believe he has [END]
read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of [END]
he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay [END]
in one of the window seats but he reads all _them_ to himself [END]
but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read [END]
something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining [END]
and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield [END]
he never read the [END]
romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey [END]
he had never [END]
heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined [END]
to get them now as soon as ever he can [END]
the next question was [END]
what sort of looking man is mr [END]
martin [END]
oh [END]
not handsome not at all handsome [END]
i thought him very plain [END]
at first but i do not think him so plain now [END]
one does not you know [END]
after a time [END]
but did you never see him [END]
he is in highbury every [END]
now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way [END]
to kingston [END]
he has passed you very often [END]
that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without [END]
having any idea of his name [END]
a young farmer whether on horseback [END]
or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity [END]
the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i [END]
can have nothing to do [END]
a degree or two lower and a creditable [END]
appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their [END]
families in some way or other [END]
but a farmer can need none of my help [END]
and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every [END]
other he is below it [END]
to be sure [END]
oh yes [END]
it is not likely you should ever have [END]
observed him but he knows you very well indeed i mean by sight [END]
i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man [END]
i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well [END]
what do you imagine his age to be [END]
he was four-and-twenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is [END]
the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference which is very odd [END]
only four-and-twenty [END]
that is too young to settle [END]
his mother is [END]
perfectly right not to be in a hurry [END]
they seem very comfortable [END]
as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him [END]
she would probably repent it [END]
six years hence if he could meet [END]
with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own [END]
with a little money it might be very desirable [END]
six years hence [END]
dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old [END]
well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry [END]
who are not born to an independence [END]
mr martin i imagine [END]
has his fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with [END]
the world [END]
whatever money he might come into when his father died [END]
whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say [END]
all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though [END]
with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to [END]
impossible that he should have realised any thing yet [END]
to be sure so it is [END]
but they live very comfortably [END]
they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing [END]
and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year [END]
i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does [END]
marry i mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though [END]
his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether [END]
objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit [END]
for you to notice [END]
the misfortune of your birth ought to make you [END]
particularly careful as to your associates [END]
there can be no doubt [END]
of your being a gentleman's daughter and you must support your [END]
claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there [END]
will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you [END]
yes to be sure i suppose there are [END]
but while i visit [END]
at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse [END]
i am not afraid of what any body can do [END]
you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i [END]
would have you so firmly established in good society as to be [END]
independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse [END]
i want to see you [END]
permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable [END]
to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say [END]
that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries [END]
i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters [END]
to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere [END]
farmer's daughter without education [END]
to be sure [END]
yes [END]
not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body [END]
but what had had some education and been very well brought up [END]
however i do not mean to set up my opinion against your's and i [END]
am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife [END]
i shall [END]
always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth [END]
and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well [END]
educated as me [END]
but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman [END]
certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it [END]
emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech [END]
and saw no alarming symptoms of love [END]
the young man had been [END]
the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold [END]
and that there would be no serious difficulty on harriet's side [END]
to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own [END]
they met mr martin the very next day as they were walking on the [END]
donwell road [END]
he was on foot and after looking very respectfully [END]
at her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion [END]
emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey [END]
and walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made [END]
her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr robert martin [END]
his appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man [END]
but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be [END]
contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground [END]
he had gained in harriet's inclination [END]
harriet was not insensible [END]
of manner she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness [END]
with admiration as well as wonder [END]
mr martin looked as if he [END]
did not know what manner was [END]
they remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must [END]
not be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her with a [END]
smiling face and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse [END]
hoped very soon to compose [END]
only think of our happening to meet him how very odd [END]
it was [END]
quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls [END]
he did not think we ever walked this road [END]
he thought we walked [END]
towards randalls most days [END]
he has not been able to get the [END]
romance of the forest yet [END]
he was so busy the last time he was [END]
at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to-morrow [END]
so very odd we should happen to meet [END]
well miss woodhouse is he [END]
like what you expected [END]
what do you think of him [END]
do you think him [END]
so very plain [END]
he is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is [END]
nothing compared with his entire want of gentility [END]
i had no [END]
right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no [END]
idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air [END]
i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility [END]
to be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not [END]
so genteel as real gentlemen [END]
i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been [END]
repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen [END]
that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin [END]
at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated [END]
well bred men [END]
i should be surprized if after seeing them [END]
you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving [END]
him to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at [END]
yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before [END]
do not you begin to feel that now [END]
were not you struck [END]
i am sure [END]
you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner [END]
and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated [END]
as i stood here [END]
certainly he is not like mr knightley [END]
he has not such a fine [END]
air and way of walking as mr knightley [END]
i see the difference [END]
plain enough [END]
but mr knightley is so very fine a man [END]
mr knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair [END]
to compare mr martin with _him_ [END]
you might not see one in a hundred [END]
with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in mr knightley [END]
but he is [END]
not the only gentleman you have been lately used to [END]
what say you [END]
to mr weston and mr elton [END]
compare mr martin with either of _them_ [END]
compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking [END]
of being silent [END]
you must see the difference [END]
oh yes there is a great difference [END]
but mr weston is almost [END]
an old man [END]
mr weston must be between forty and fifty [END]
which makes his good manners the more valuable [END]
the older a [END]
person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners [END]
should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness [END]
or coarseness or awkwardness becomes [END]
what is passable in youth [END]
is detestable in later age [END]
mr martin is now awkward and abrupt [END]
what will he be at mr weston's time of life [END]
there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly [END]
but there may be pretty good guessing [END]
he will be a completely gross [END]
vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking [END]
of nothing but profit and loss [END]
will he indeed [END]
that will be very bad [END]
how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the [END]
circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended [END]
he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing [END]
else which is just as it should be for a thriving man [END]
what has [END]
he to do with books [END]
and i have no doubt that he _will_ thrive [END]
and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse [END]
need not disturb _us_ [END]
i wonder he did not remember the book was all harriet's answer [END]
and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might [END]
be safely left to itself [END]
she therefore said no more for some time [END]
her next beginning was [END]
in one respect perhaps mr elton's manners are superior [END]
to mr knightley's or mr weston's [END]
they have more gentleness [END]
they might be more safely held up as a pattern [END]
there is an openness [END]
a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body [END]
likes in _him_ because there is so much good-humour with it but [END]
that would not do to be copied [END]
neither would mr knightley's [END]
downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits [END]
_him_ very well his figure and look and situation in life seem [END]
to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him [END]
he would not be sufferable [END]
on the contrary i think a young man [END]
might be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model [END]
mr elton is good-humoured cheerful obliging and gentle [END]
he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late [END]
i do not [END]
know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either [END]
of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his [END]
manners are softer than they used to be [END]
if he means any thing [END]
it must be to please you [END]
did not i tell you what he said of you [END]
the other day [END]
she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn [END]
from mr elton and now did full justice to and harriet blushed [END]
and smiled and said she had always thought mr elton very agreeable [END]
mr elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving [END]
the young farmer out of harriet's head [END]
she thought it would [END]
be an excellent match and only too palpably desirable natural [END]
and probable for her to have much merit in planning it [END]
she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict [END]
it was not likely however that any body should have equalled [END]
her in the date of the plan as it had entered her brain during [END]
the very first evening of harriet's coming to hartfield [END]
the longer [END]
she considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency [END]
mr elton's situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself [END]
and without low connexions at the same time not of any family [END]
that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet [END]
he had a [END]
comfortable home for her and emma imagined a very sufficient income [END]
for though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known [END]
to have some independent property and she thought very highly [END]
of him as a good-humoured well-meaning respectable young man [END]
without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world [END]
she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful [END]
girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield [END]
was foundation enough on his side and on harriet's there could be [END]
little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all [END]
the usual weight and efficacy [END]
and he was really a very pleasing [END]
young man a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like [END]
he was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general [END]
though not by her there being a want of elegance of feature which [END]
she could not dispense with but the girl who could be gratified [END]
by a robert martin's riding about the country to get walnuts [END]
for her might very well be conquered by mr elton's admiration [END]
chapter v [END]
i do not know what your opinion may be mrs weston said mr knightley of [END]
this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing [END]
a bad thing [END]
do you really think it a bad thing why so [END]
i think they will neither of them do the other any good [END]
you surprize me [END]
emma must do harriet good and by supplying her [END]
with a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good [END]
i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure [END]
how very differently we feel not think they will do each other any [END]
good [END]
this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels [END]
about emma mr [END]
knightley [END]
perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you [END]
knowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle [END]
mr weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here [END]
for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject [END]
we were speaking [END]
of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma [END]
that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with [END]
mr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case [END]
you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value [END]
of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort [END]
a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used [END]
to it all her life [END]
i can imagine your objection to harriet smith [END]
she is not the superior young woman which emma's friend ought to be [END]
but on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed [END]
it will be an inducement to her to read more herself [END]
they will [END]
read together [END]
she means it i know [END]
emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve [END]
years old [END]
i have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at [END]
various times of books that she meant to read regularly through and [END]
very good lists they were very well chosen and very neatly [END]
arranged sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule [END]
the list she drew up when only fourteen i remember thinking it [END]
did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time [END]
and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now [END]
but i [END]
have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma [END]
she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience [END]
and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding [END]
where miss taylor [END]
failed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do [END]
nothing you never could persuade her to read half so much as you [END]
wished you know you could not [END]
i dare say replied mrs weston smiling that i thought [END]
so _then_ but since we have parted i can never remember emma's [END]
omitting to do any thing i wished [END]
there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ said [END]
mr knightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done [END]
but i [END]
he soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses [END]
must still see hear and remember [END]
emma is spoiled by being the [END]
cleverest of her family [END]
at ten years old she had the misfortune of [END]
being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen [END]
she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident [END]
and ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house [END]
and of you all [END]
in her mother she lost the only person able to cope [END]
with her [END]
she inherits her mother's talents and must have been [END]
under subjection to her [END]
i should have been sorry mr knightley to be dependent on [END]
_your_ recommendation had i quitted mr woodhouse's family and wanted [END]
another situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for [END]
me to any body [END]
i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held [END]
yes said he smiling [END]
you are better placed _here_ very fit [END]
for a wife but not at all for a governess [END]
but you were preparing [END]
yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield [END]
you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would [END]
seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from _her_ [END]
on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will [END]
and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend [END]
him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor [END]
thank you [END]
there will be very little merit in making a good wife [END]
to such a man as mr [END]
weston [END]
why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away [END]
and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing [END]
to be borne [END]
we will not despair however [END]
weston may grow cross [END]
from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him [END]
i hope not _that_ it is not likely [END]
no mr knightley do not [END]
foretell vexation from that quarter [END]
not i indeed [END]
i only name possibilities [END]
i do not pretend to emma's [END]
genius for foretelling and guessing [END]
i hope with all my heart [END]
the young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortune but [END]
harriet smith i have not half done about harriet smith [END]
i think [END]
her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have [END]
she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing [END]
she is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse [END]
because undesigned [END]
her ignorance is hourly flattery [END]
how can [END]
emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet [END]
is presenting such a delightful inferiority [END]
and as for harriet [END]
i will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance [END]
hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places [END]
she belongs to [END]
she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable [END]
with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home [END]
i am much mistaken if emma's doctrines give any strength of mind [END]
or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties [END]
of her situation in life they only give a little polish [END]
i either depend more upon emma's good sense than you do or am more [END]
anxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance [END]
how well she looked last night [END]
oh [END]
you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you [END]
very well i shall not attempt to deny emma's being pretty [END]
pretty [END]
say beautiful rather [END]
can you imagine any thing nearer [END]
perfect beauty than emma altogether face and figure [END]
i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have [END]
seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers [END]
but i am a partial old friend [END]
such an eye the true hazle eye and so brilliant [END]
regular features [END]
open countenance with a complexion [END]
oh [END]
what a bloom of full health [END]
and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure [END]
there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head [END]
her glance [END]
one hears sometimes of a child being the picture [END]
of health ' now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete [END]
picture of grown-up health [END]
she is loveliness itself [END]
mr knightley [END]
is not she [END]
i have not a fault to find with her person he replied [END]
i think her all you describe [END]
i love to look at her and i [END]
will add this praise that i do not think her personally vain [END]
considering how very handsome she is she appears to be little [END]
occupied with it her vanity lies another way [END]
mrs weston i am [END]
not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread [END]
of its doing them both harm [END]
and i mr knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its [END]
not doing them any harm [END]
with all dear emma's little faults [END]
she is an excellent creature [END]
where shall we see a better daughter [END]
or a kinder sister or a truer friend [END]
no no she has qualities [END]
which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong [END]
she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the [END]
right a hundred times [END]
very well i will not plague you any more [END]
emma shall be an angel [END]
and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john [END]
and isabella [END]
john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore [END]
not a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does [END]
except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children [END]
i am sure of having their opinions with me [END]
i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind [END]
but excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself [END]
you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma's [END]
mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think [END]
any possible good can arise from harriet smith's intimacy being made [END]
a matter of much discussion among you [END]
pray excuse me but supposing [END]
any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy [END]
it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father [END]
who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it [END]
so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself [END]
it has been so [END]
many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized [END]
mr knightley at this little remains of office [END]
not at all cried he i am much obliged to you for it [END]
it is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your [END]
advice has often found for it shall be attended to [END]
mrs john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy [END]
about her sister [END]
be satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry [END]
i will keep [END]
my ill-humour to myself [END]
i have a very sincere interest in emma [END]
isabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a [END]
greater interest perhaps hardly so great [END]
there is an anxiety [END]
a curiosity in what one feels for emma [END]
i wonder what will become [END]
of her [END]
so do i said mrs weston gently very much [END]
she always declares she will never marry which of course [END]
means just nothing at all [END]
but i have no idea that she has yet [END]
ever seen a man she cared for [END]
it would not be a bad thing for her [END]
to be very much in love with a proper object [END]
i should like to see [END]
emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good [END]
but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom [END]
from home [END]
there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break [END]
her resolution at present said mrs weston as can well be [END]
and while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be [END]
forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties [END]
on poor mr woodhouse's account [END]
i do not recommend matrimony [END]
at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you [END]
part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of [END]
her own and mr weston's on the subject as much as possible [END]
there were wishes at randalls respecting emma's destiny but it [END]
was not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition [END]
which mr knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston [END]
think of the weather shall we have rain [END]
convinced her that he [END]
had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield [END]
chapter vi [END]
emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet's fancy [END]
a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity [END]
to a very good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible [END]
than before of mr elton's being a remarkably handsome man with most [END]
agreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up [END]
the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon [END]
pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet's side [END]
as there could be any occasion for [END]
she was quite convinced [END]
of mr elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love [END]
if not in love already [END]
she had no scruple with regard to him [END]
he talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could [END]
not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add [END]
his perception of the striking improvement of harriet's manner [END]
since her introduction at hartfield was not one of the least [END]
agreeable proofs of his growing attachment [END]
you have given miss smith all that she required said he [END]
you have made her graceful and easy [END]
she was a beautiful creature [END]
when she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have [END]
added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature [END]
i am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet [END]
only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints [END]
she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness [END]
in herself [END]
i have done very little [END]
if it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant [END]
mr elton [END]
i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character [END]
have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her [END]
way before [END]
exactly so that is what principally strikes me [END]
so much superadded [END]
decision of character [END]
skilful has been the hand [END]
great has been the pleasure i am sure [END]
i never met with [END]
a disposition more truly amiable [END]
i have no doubt of it [END]
and it was spoken with a sort [END]
of sighing animation which had a vast deal of the lover [END]
she was not less pleased another day with the manner [END]
in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers to have harriet's picture [END]
did you ever have your likeness taken harriet [END]
said she did [END]
you ever sit for your picture [END]
harriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say [END]
with a very interesting naivete [END]
oh [END]
dear no never [END]
no sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed [END]
what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be [END]
i would [END]
give any money for it [END]
i almost long to attempt her likeness myself [END]
you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had [END]
a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of [END]
my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general [END]
but from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust [END]
but really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me [END]
it would be such a delight to have her picture [END]
let me entreat you cried mr elton it would indeed be a delight [END]
let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a [END]
talent in favour of your friend [END]
i know what your drawings are [END]
how could you suppose me ignorant [END]
is not this room rich in [END]
specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston [END]
some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room at randalls [END]
yes good man thought emma but what has all that to do with taking [END]
likenesses [END]
you know nothing of drawing [END]
don't pretend to be [END]
in raptures about mine [END]
keep your raptures for harriet's face [END]
well if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe [END]
i shall try what i can do [END]
harriet's features are very delicate [END]
which makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity [END]
in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought [END]
to catch [END]
exactly so the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth i [END]
have not a doubt of your success [END]
pray pray attempt it [END]
as you will do it it will indeed to use your own words [END]
be an exquisite possession [END]
but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit [END]
she thinks so little of her own beauty [END]
did not you observe her [END]
manner of answering me [END]
how completely it meant why should my [END]
picture be drawn ' [END]
oh [END]
yes i observed it i assure you [END]
it was not lost on me [END]
but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded [END]
harriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made [END]
and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest [END]
pressing of both the others [END]
emma wished to go to work directly [END]
and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts [END]
at portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they [END]
might decide together on the best size for harriet [END]
her many [END]
beginnings were displayed [END]
miniatures half-lengths whole-lengths [END]
pencil crayon and water-colours had been all tried in turn [END]
she had always wanted to do every thing and had made more progress [END]
both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little [END]
labour as she would ever submit to [END]
she played and sang and drew [END]
in almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting [END]
and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she [END]
would have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of [END]
she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist [END]
or a musician but she was not unwilling to have others deceived [END]
or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher [END]
than it deserved [END]
there was merit in every drawing in the least finished perhaps the most [END]
her style was spirited but had there been much less or had there [END]
been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions [END]
would have been the same [END]
they were both in ecstasies [END]
a likeness [END]
pleases every body and miss woodhouse's performances must be capital [END]
no great variety of faces for you said emma [END]
i had only my [END]
own family to study from [END]
there is my father another of my [END]
father but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous [END]
that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very [END]
like therefore [END]
mrs weston again and again and again you see [END]
dear mrs weston [END]
always my kindest friend on every occasion [END]
she would sit whenever i asked her [END]
there is my sister and really [END]
quite her own little elegant figure and the face not unlike [END]
i should have made a good likeness of her if she would have [END]
sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four [END]
children that she would not be quiet [END]
then here come all my [END]
attempts at three of those four children there they are [END]
henry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other [END]
and any one of them might do for any one of the rest [END]
she was so [END]
eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no [END]
making children of three or four years old stand still you know [END]
nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the [END]
air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any [END]
of mama's children ever were [END]
here is my sketch of the fourth [END]
who was a baby [END]
i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it [END]
is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see [END]
he had nestled down his head most conveniently [END]
that's very like [END]
i am rather proud of little george [END]
the corner of the sofa is very good [END]
then here is my last unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman [END]
in small size whole-length my last and my best my brother [END]
mr john knightley this did not want much of being finished when i [END]
put it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness [END]
i could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i [END]
had really made a very good likeness of it mrs weston and i [END]
were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like only too handsome too [END]
flattering but that was a fault on the right side after [END]
all this came poor dear isabella's cold approbation of yes [END]
it was a little like but to be sure it did not do him justice [END]
we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all [END]
it was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i [END]
could bear and so i never would finish it to have it apologised [END]
over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in [END]
brunswick square and as i said i did then forswear ever drawing [END]
any body again [END]
but for harriet's sake or rather for my own [END]
and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_ [END]
i will break my resolution now [END]
mr elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea [END]
and was repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present [END]
indeed as you observe [END]
exactly so [END]
no husbands and wives [END]
with so interesting a consciousness that emma began to consider [END]
whether she had not better leave them together at once [END]
but as she [END]
wanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer [END]
she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait [END]
it was to be a whole-length in water-colours like mr john [END]
knightley's and was destined if she could please herself [END]
to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece [END]
the sitting began and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid [END]
of not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet [END]
mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist [END]
but there was no doing any thing with mr elton fidgeting behind [END]
her and watching every touch [END]
she gave him credit for stationing [END]
himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence [END]
but was really obliged to put an end to it and request him to [END]
place himself elsewhere [END]
it then occurred to her to employ him [END]
in reading [END]
if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness [END]
indeed [END]
it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen [END]
the irksomeness of miss smith's [END]
mr elton was only too happy [END]
harriet listened and emma drew [END]
in peace [END]
she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look [END]
any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover [END]
and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil [END]
to jump up and see the progress and be charmed there was no [END]
being displeased with such an encourager for his admiration [END]
made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible [END]
she could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance [END]
were unexceptionable [END]
the sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite [END]
enough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on [END]
there was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude [END]
and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure [END]
to give a little more height and considerably more elegance she had [END]
great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last [END]
and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both a [END]
standing memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other [END]
and the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations [END]
as mr elton's very promising attachment was likely to add [END]
harriet was to sit again the next day and mr elton just as he ought [END]
entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again [END]
by all means [END]
we shall be most happy to consider you as one [END]
of the party [END]
the same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction [END]
took place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress [END]
of the picture which was rapid and happy [END]
every body who saw it [END]
was pleased but mr elton was in continual raptures and defended [END]
it through every criticism [END]
miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she [END]
wanted observed mrs weston to him not in the least suspecting [END]
that she was addressing a lover the expression of the eye is [END]
most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes [END]
it is the fault of her face that she has them not [END]
do you think so [END]
replied he [END]
i cannot agree with you [END]
it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature [END]
i never saw such a likeness in my life [END]
we must allow for the effect [END]
of shade you know [END]
you have made her too tall emma said mr knightley [END]
emma knew that she had but would not own it and mr elton warmly added [END]
oh no [END]
certainly not too tall not in the least too tall [END]
consider [END]
she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which [END]
in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must [END]
be preserved you know [END]
proportions fore-shortening oh no [END]
it [END]
gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith's [END]
exactly so indeed [END]
it is very pretty said mr woodhouse [END]
so prettily done [END]
just [END]
as your drawings always are my dear [END]
i do not know any body who draws [END]
so well as you do [END]
the only thing i do not thoroughly like is [END]
that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl [END]
over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold [END]
but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer [END]
look at the tree [END]
but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear [END]
you sir may say any thing cried mr elton but i must confess [END]
that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss [END]
smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable [END]
spirit [END]
any other situation would have been much less in character [END]
the naivete of miss smith's manners and altogether oh it is [END]
most admirable [END]
i cannot keep my eyes from it [END]
i never saw such [END]
a likeness [END]
the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a [END]
few difficulties [END]
it must be done directly it must be done in london [END]
the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste [END]
could be depended on and isabella the usual doer of all commissions [END]
must not be applied to because it was december and mr woodhouse [END]
could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs [END]
of december [END]
but no sooner was the distress known to mr elton [END]
than it was removed [END]
his gallantry was always on the alert [END]
might he be trusted with the commission what infinite pleasure [END]
should he have in executing it [END]
he could ride to london at any time [END]
it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being [END]
employed on such an errand [END]
he was too good she could not endure the thought she would [END]
not give him such a troublesome office for the world brought [END]
on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances and [END]
a very few minutes settled the business [END]
mr elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame [END]
and give the directions and emma thought she could so pack it [END]
as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he [END]
seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough [END]
what a precious deposit [END]
said he with a tender sigh as he [END]
received it [END]
this man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma [END]
i should say so but that i suppose there may be a hundred different [END]
ways of being in love [END]
he is an excellent young man and will suit [END]
harriet exactly it will be an exactly so ' as he says himself [END]
but he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more [END]
than i could endure as a principal [END]
i come in for a pretty good [END]
share as a second [END]
but it is his gratitude on harriet's account [END]
chapter vii [END]
the very day of mr elton's going to london produced a fresh occasion [END]
for emma's services towards her friend [END]
harriet had been at hartfield [END]
as usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home [END]
to return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been [END]
talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something [END]
extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell [END]
half a minute brought it all out [END]
she had heard as soon as she got [END]
back to mrs goddard's that mr martin had been there an hour before [END]
and finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left [END]
a little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away [END]
and on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two [END]
songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself [END]
and this letter was from him from mr martin and contained a direct [END]
proposal of marriage [END]
who could have thought it [END]
she was so surprized [END]
she did not know what to do [END]
yes quite a proposal of marriage [END]
and a very good letter at least she thought so [END]
and he wrote [END]
as if he really loved her very much but she did not know and so [END]
she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she [END]
should do emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so [END]
pleased and so doubtful [END]
upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose [END]
any thing for want of asking [END]
he will connect himself well if he can [END]
will you read the letter [END]
cried harriet [END]
pray do [END]
i'd rather [END]
you would [END]
emma was not sorry to be pressed [END]
she read and was surprized [END]
the style of the letter was much above her expectation [END]
there were not merely no grammatical errors but as a composition it [END]
would not have disgraced a gentleman the language though plain [END]
was strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much [END]
to the credit of the writer [END]
it was short but expressed good sense [END]
warm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling [END]
she paused over it while harriet stood anxiously watching for [END]
her opinion with a well well and was at last forced to add [END]
is it a good letter [END]
or is it too short [END]
yes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowly so [END]
good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of [END]
his sisters must have helped him [END]
i can hardly imagine the young [END]
man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself [END]
so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the [END]
style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise [END]
not diffuse enough for a woman [END]
no doubt he is a sensible man [END]
and i suppose may have a natural talent for thinks strongly and [END]
clearly and when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find [END]
proper words [END]
it is so with some men [END]
yes i understand the sort [END]
of mind [END]
vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point [END]
not coarse [END]
a better written letter harriet returning it [END]
than i had expected [END]
well said the still waiting harriet well and and what [END]
shall i do [END]
what shall you do [END]
in what respect [END]
do you mean with regard [END]
to this letter [END]
yes [END]
but what are you in doubt of [END]
you must answer it of course and speedily [END]
yes [END]
but what shall i say [END]
dear miss woodhouse do advise me [END]
oh no no [END]
the letter had much better be all your own [END]
you will [END]
express yourself very properly i am sure [END]
there is no danger of your [END]
not being intelligible which is the first thing [END]
your meaning must [END]
be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude [END]
and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires [END]
will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind i am persuaded [END]
you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow [END]
for his disappointment [END]
you think i ought to refuse him then said harriet looking down [END]
ought to refuse him [END]
my dear harriet what do you mean [END]
are you [END]
in any doubt as to that [END]
i thought but i beg your pardon perhaps i [END]
have been under a mistake [END]
i certainly have been misunderstanding [END]
you if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer [END]
i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it [END]
harriet was silent [END]
with a little reserve of manner emma continued [END]
you mean to return a favourable answer i collect [END]
no i do not that is i do not mean what shall i do [END]
what would [END]
you advise me to do [END]
pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i [END]
ought to do [END]
i shall not give you any advice harriet [END]
i will have nothing to [END]
do with it [END]
this is a point which you must settle with your feelings [END]
i had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet [END]
contemplating the letter [END]
for a little while emma persevered [END]
in her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery [END]
of that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say [END]
i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman _doubts_ [END]
as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought [END]
to refuse him [END]
if she can hesitate as to yes ' she ought to say [END]
no' directly [END]
it is not a state to be safely entered into [END]
with doubtful feelings with half a heart [END]
i thought it my duty [END]
as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you [END]
but do not imagine that i want to influence you [END]
oh [END]
no i am sure you are a great deal too kind to but if you [END]
would just advise me what i had best do no no i do not mean [END]
that as you say one's mind ought to be quite made up one should [END]
not be hesitating it is a very serious thing it will be safer [END]
to say no ' perhaps do you think i had better say no ' [END]
not for the world said emma smiling graciously would i advise [END]
you either way [END]
you must be the best judge of your own happiness [END]
if you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him [END]
the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should [END]
you hesitate [END]
you blush harriet does any body else occur to you [END]
at this moment under such a definition [END]
harriet harriet do not [END]
deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion [END]
at this moment whom are you thinking of [END]
the symptoms were favourable instead of answering harriet turned [END]
away confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire and though [END]
the letter was still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted [END]
about without regard [END]
emma waited the result with impatience [END]
but not without strong hopes [END]
at last with some hesitation [END]
harriet said [END]
miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must [END]
do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined [END]
and really almost made up my mind to refuse mr martin [END]
do you [END]
think i am right [END]
perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just [END]
what you ought [END]
while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings [END]
to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no [END]
hesitation in approving [END]
dear harriet i give myself joy of this [END]
it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have [END]
been the consequence of your marrying mr martin [END]
while you were in [END]
the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would [END]
not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me [END]
i could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbey-mill farm [END]
now i am secure of you for ever [END]
harriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck [END]
her forcibly [END]
you could not have visited me [END]
she cried looking aghast [END]
no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before [END]
that would have been too dreadful what an escape dear miss woodhouse [END]
i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you [END]
for any thing in the world [END]
indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you [END]
but it must have been [END]
you would have thrown yourself out of all [END]
good society [END]
i must have given you up [END]
dear me how should i ever have borne it [END]
it would have killed [END]
me never to come to hartfield any more [END]
dear affectionate creature _you_ banished to abbey-mill farm _you_ [END]
confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life [END]
i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it [END]
he must have a pretty good opinion of himself [END]
i do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet [END]
her conscience opposing such censure at least he is very good natured [END]
and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard [END]
for but that is quite a different thing from and you know [END]
though he may like me it does not follow that i should and [END]
certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen [END]
people and if one comes to compare them person and manners [END]
there is no comparison at all _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable [END]
however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man [END]
and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached [END]
to me and his writing such a letter but as to leaving you [END]
it is what i would not do upon any consideration [END]
thank you thank you my own sweet little friend [END]
we will not [END]
be parted [END]
a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked [END]
or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter [END]
oh no and it is but a short letter too [END]
emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a [END]
very true and it would be a small consolation to her for the [END]
clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day [END]
to know that her husband could write a good letter [END]
oh [END]
yes very [END]
nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always [END]
happy with pleasant companions [END]
i am quite determined to refuse him [END]
but how shall i do [END]
what shall i say [END]
emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer [END]
and advised its being written directly which was agreed to [END]
in the hope of her assistance and though emma continued to protest [END]
against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the [END]
formation of every sentence [END]
the looking over his letter again [END]
in replying to it had such a softening tendency that it was [END]
particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions [END]
and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy [END]
and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say [END]
and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful [END]
that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment [END]
he would have been accepted after all [END]
this letter however was written and sealed and sent [END]
the business was finished and harriet safe [END]
she was rather low [END]
all the evening but emma could allow for her amiable regrets [END]
and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection [END]
sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr elton [END]
i shall never be invited to abbey-mill again was said in rather [END]
a sorrowful tone [END]
nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet [END]
you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared [END]
to abbey-mill [END]
and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy [END]
but at hartfield [END]
some time afterwards it was i think mrs goddard would be very [END]
much surprized if she knew what had happened [END]
i am sure miss nash [END]
would for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married [END]
and it is only a linen-draper [END]
one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the [END]
teacher of a school harriet [END]
i dare say miss nash would envy you [END]
such an opportunity as this of being married [END]
even this conquest [END]
would appear valuable in her eyes [END]
as to any thing superior for you [END]
i suppose she is quite in the dark [END]
the attentions of a certain [END]
person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of highbury yet [END]
hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks [END]
and manners have explained themselves [END]
harriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering [END]
that people should like her so much [END]
the idea of mr elton was [END]
certainly cheering but still after a time she was tender-hearted [END]
again towards the rejected mr martin [END]
now he has got my letter said she softly [END]
i wonder what they [END]
are all doing whether his sisters know if he is unhappy [END]
they will be unhappy too [END]
i hope he will not mind it so very much [END]
let us think of those among our absent friends who are more [END]
cheerfully employed cried emma [END]
at this moment perhaps mr elton [END]
is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much [END]
more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five [END]
or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name [END]
my picture but he has left my picture in bond-street [END]
has he so then i know nothing of mr elton [END]
no my dear [END]
little modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be [END]
in bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow [END]
it is his companion all this evening his solace his delight [END]
it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them [END]
it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature [END]
eager curiosity and warm prepossession [END]
how cheerful how animated [END]
how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are [END]
harriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger [END]
chapter viii [END]
harriet slept at hartfield that night [END]
for some weeks past she [END]
had been spending more than half her time there and gradually [END]
getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself and emma [END]
judged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her [END]
with them as much as possible just at present [END]
she was obliged [END]
to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs goddard's [END]
but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield [END]
to make a regular visit of some days [END]
while she was gone mr knightley called and sat some time with [END]
mr woodhouse and emma till mr woodhouse who had previously made up [END]
his mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it [END]
and was induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples [END]
of his own civility to leave mr knightley for that purpose [END]
mr knightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering [END]
by his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted [END]
apologies and civil hesitations of the other [END]
well i believe if you will excuse me mr knightley if you [END]
will not consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take [END]
emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour [END]
as the sun [END]
is out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can [END]
i treat you without ceremony mr knightley [END]
we invalids think we [END]
are privileged people [END]
my dear sir do not make a stranger of me [END]
i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter [END]
emma will be happy [END]
to entertain you [END]
and therefore i think i will beg your excuse [END]
and take my three turns my winter walk [END]
you cannot do better sir [END]
i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley [END]
but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you [END]
and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey [END]
thank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i [END]
think the sooner _you_ go the better [END]
i will fetch your greatcoat [END]
and open the garden door for you [END]
mr woodhouse at last was off but mr knightley instead of being [END]
immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined [END]
for more chat [END]
he began speaking of harriet and speaking [END]
of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before [END]
i cannot rate her beauty as you do said he but she is a [END]
pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of [END]
her disposition [END]
her character depends upon those she is with [END]
but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman [END]
i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting [END]
come said he you are anxious for a compliment so i will [END]
tell you that you have improved her [END]
you have cured her of her [END]
school-girl's giggle she really does you credit [END]
thank you [END]
i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i [END]
had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow [END]
praise where they may [END]
_you_ do not often overpower me with it [END]
you are expecting her again you say this morning [END]
almost every moment [END]
she has been gone longer already than [END]
she intended [END]
something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps [END]
highbury gossips tiresome wretches [END]
harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would [END]
emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore [END]
said nothing [END]
he presently added with a smile [END]
i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you [END]
that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon [END]
hear of something to her advantage [END]
indeed [END]
how so [END]
of what sort [END]
a very serious sort i assure you still smiling [END]
very serious [END]
i can think of but one thing who is in love [END]
with her [END]
who makes you their confidant [END]
emma was more than half in hopes of mr elton's having dropt a hint [END]
mr knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew [END]
mr elton looked up to him [END]
i have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will [END]
soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable [END]
quarter robert martin is the man [END]
her visit to abbey-mill [END]
this summer seems to have done his business [END]
he is desperately [END]
in love and means to marry her [END]
he is very obliging said emma but is he sure that harriet [END]
means to marry him [END]
well well means to make her an offer then [END]
will that do [END]
he came [END]
to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it [END]
he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and [END]
i believe considers me as one of his best friends [END]
he came to ask [END]
me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early [END]
whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his [END]
choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being [END]
considered especially since _your_ making so much of her as in a line [END]
of society above him [END]
i was very much pleased with all that he said [END]
i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin [END]
he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very [END]
well judging [END]
he told me every thing his circumstances and plans [END]
and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage [END]
he is [END]
an excellent young man both as son and brother [END]
i had no hesitation [END]
in advising him to marry [END]
he proved to me that he could afford it [END]
and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better [END]
i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy [END]
if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought [END]
highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the [END]
best friend and counsellor man ever had [END]
this happened the night [END]
before last [END]
now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow [END]
much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not [END]
appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should [END]
be at mrs goddard's to-day and she may be detained by a visitor [END]
without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch [END]
pray mr knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself [END]
through a great part of this speech how do you know that mr martin [END]
did not speak yesterday [END]
certainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it [END]
but it may be inferred [END]
was not she the whole day with you [END]
come said she i will tell you something in return for what [END]
you have told me [END]
he did speak yesterday that is he wrote [END]
and was refused [END]
this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed [END]
and mr knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure [END]
as he stood up in tall indignation and said [END]
then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her [END]
what is the foolish girl about [END]
oh [END]
to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible [END]
to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage [END]
a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her [END]
nonsense [END]
a man does not imagine any such thing [END]
but what is [END]
the meaning of this [END]
harriet smith refuse robert martin [END]
madness [END]
if it is so but i hope you are mistaken [END]
i saw her answer nothing could be clearer [END]
you saw her answer you wrote her answer too [END]
emma this is [END]
your doing [END]
you persuaded her to refuse him [END]
and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should [END]
not feel that i had done wrong [END]
mr martin is a very respectable [END]
young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet's equal and am [END]
rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her [END]
by your account he does seem to have had some scruples [END]
it is [END]
a pity that they were ever got over [END]
not harriet's equal [END]
exclaimed mr knightley loudly and warmly [END]
and with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards no he [END]
is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense [END]
as in situation [END]
emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you [END]
what are harriet smith's claims either of birth nature or education [END]
to any connexion higher than robert martin [END]
she is the natural [END]
daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision [END]
at all and certainly no respectable relations [END]
she is known only [END]
as parlour-boarder at a common school [END]
she is not a sensible girl [END]
nor a girl of any information [END]
she has been taught nothing useful [END]
and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself [END]
at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit [END]
is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her [END]
she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all [END]
my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being [END]
beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him [END]
i felt that [END]
as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as [END]
to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse [END]
but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing [END]
to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort [END]
of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led [END]
aright and turn out very well [END]
the advantage of the match i felt [END]
to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now [END]
that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck [END]
even _your_ satisfaction i made sure of [END]
it crossed my mind immediately [END]
that you would not regret your friend's leaving highbury for the [END]
sake of her being settled so well [END]
i remember saying to myself [END]
even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a [END]
good match ' [END]
i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say [END]
any such thing [END]
what [END]
think a farmer and with all his sense and all [END]
his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate [END]
friend [END]
not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying [END]
a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own [END]
i [END]
wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings [END]
i assure you mine are very different [END]
i must think your statement [END]
by no means fair [END]
you are not just to harriet's claims [END]
they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself [END]
mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly [END]
her inferior as to rank in society the sphere in which she moves [END]
is much above his it would be a degradation [END]
a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married [END]
to a respectable intelligent gentleman-farmer [END]
as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense [END]
she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense [END]
she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below [END]
the level of those with whom she is brought up there can scarcely [END]
be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of [END]
fortune her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged [END]
for her improvement or comfort that she is a gentleman's daughter [END]
is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen's daughters [END]
no one i apprehend will deny she is superior to mr robert martin [END]
whoever might be her parents said mr knightley whoever may [END]
have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part [END]
of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society [END]
after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in [END]
mrs goddard's hands to shift as she can to move in short [END]
in mrs goddard's line to have mrs goddard's acquaintance [END]
her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it _was_ [END]
good enough [END]
she desired nothing better herself [END]
till you chose [END]
to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set [END]
nor any ambition beyond it [END]
she was as happy as possible with the [END]
martins in the summer [END]
she had no sense of superiority then [END]
if she has it now you have given it [END]
you have been no friend to [END]
harriet smith emma [END]
robert martin would never have proceeded so far [END]
if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him [END]
i know him well [END]
he has too much real feeling to address any [END]
woman on the haphazard of selfish passion [END]
and as to conceit [END]
he is the farthest from it of any man i know [END]
depend upon it he [END]
had encouragement [END]
it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this [END]
assertion she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again [END]
you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before [END]
are unjust to harriet [END]
harriet's claims to marry well are not [END]
so contemptible as you represent them [END]
she is not a clever girl [END]
but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not [END]
deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly [END]
waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you [END]
describe her only pretty and good-natured let me tell you that in [END]
the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations [END]
to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl [END]
and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred [END]
and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject [END]
of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall [END]
in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl [END]
with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired [END]
and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many [END]
consequently a claim to be nice [END]
her good-nature too is not so very [END]
slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness [END]
of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great [END]
readiness to be pleased with other people [END]
i am very much mistaken [END]
if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper [END]
the highest claims a woman could possess [END]
upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have [END]
is almost enough to make me think so too [END]
better be without sense [END]
than misapply it as you do [END]
to be sure [END]
cried she playfully [END]
i know _that_ is the feeling [END]
of you all [END]
i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly [END]
what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses [END]
and satisfies his judgment [END]
oh [END]
harriet may pick and chuse [END]
were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you [END]
and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning [END]
to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first [END]
offer she receives [END]
no pray let her have time to look about her [END]
i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said mr knightley [END]
presently though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now [END]
perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet [END]
you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what [END]
she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her [END]
reach will be good enough for her [END]
vanity working on a weak head [END]
produces every sort of mischief [END]
nothing so easy as for a young lady [END]
to raise her expectations too high [END]
miss harriet smith may not find [END]
offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl [END]
men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives [END]
men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves [END]
with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be [END]
afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in [END]
when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed [END]
let her marry [END]
robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever [END]
but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach [END]
her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence [END]
and large fortune she may be a parlour-boarder at mrs goddard's [END]
all the rest of her life or at least for harriet smith is a [END]
girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate [END]
and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son [END]
we think so very differently on this point mr knightley [END]
that there can be no use in canvassing it [END]
we shall only be making [END]
each other more angry [END]
but as to my _letting_ her marry robert martin [END]
it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think [END]
as must prevent any second application [END]
she must abide by the evil [END]
of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself [END]
i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little [END]
but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do [END]
his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad [END]
that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now [END]
i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior [END]
she might tolerate him [END]
he was the brother of her friends [END]
and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen [END]
nobody better that must have been his great assistant [END]
she might not while she was at abbey-mill find him disagreeable [END]
but the case is altered now [END]
she knows now what gentlemen are [END]
and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance [END]
with harriet [END]
nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked [END]
cried mr [END]
knightley robert [END]
martin's manners have sense sincerity and good-humour to recommend [END]
them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand [END]
emma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was [END]
really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone [END]
she did not repent what she had done she still thought herself [END]
a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he [END]
could be but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment [END]
in general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her [END]
and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state [END]
was very disagreeable [END]
some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence [END]
with only one attempt on emma's side to talk of the weather [END]
but he made no answer [END]
he was thinking [END]
the result of his thoughts [END]
appeared at last in these words [END]
robert martin has no great loss if he can but think so and i [END]
hope it will not be long before he does [END]
your views for harriet [END]
are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love [END]
of match-making it is fair to suppose that views and plans [END]
and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you [END]
that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain [END]
emma laughed and disclaimed [END]
he continued [END]
depend upon it elton will not do [END]
elton is a very good sort of man [END]
and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely [END]
to make an imprudent match [END]
he knows the value of a good income [END]
as well as any body [END]
elton may talk sentimentally but he will [END]
act rationally [END]
he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you [END]
can be with harriet's [END]
he knows that he is a very handsome young man [END]
and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way [END]
of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present [END]
i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away [END]
i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family [END]
of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all [END]
twenty thousand pounds apiece [END]
i am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again [END]
if i had set my heart on mr elton's marrying harriet it would [END]
have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want [END]
to keep harriet to myself [END]
i have done with match-making indeed [END]
i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls [END]
i shall leave [END]
off while i am well [END]
good morning to you said he rising and walking off abruptly [END]
he was very much vexed [END]
he felt the disappointment of the young man [END]
and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the [END]
sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had [END]
taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly [END]
emma remained in a state of vexation too but there was more [END]
indistinctness in the causes of her's than in his [END]
she did not always [END]
feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that [END]
her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong as mr knightley [END]
he walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her [END]
she was not so materially cast down however but that a little [END]
time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives [END]
harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy [END]
the possibility of the young man's coming to mrs goddard's [END]
that morning and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause [END]
gave alarming ideas [END]
the dread of such a failure after all became the [END]
prominent uneasiness and when harriet appeared and in very good spirits [END]
and without having any such reason to give for her long absence [END]
she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind [END]
and convinced her that let mr knightley think or say what he would [END]
she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings [END]
would not justify [END]
he had frightened her a little about mr elton but when she considered [END]
that mr knightley could not have observed him as she had done [END]
neither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself [END]
in spite of mr knightley's pretensions with the skill of such [END]
an observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it [END]
hastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather [END]
said what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew [END]
any thing about [END]
he certainly might have heard mr elton speak [END]
with more unreserve than she had ever done and mr elton might not [END]
be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters [END]
he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them [END]
but then mr knightley did not make due allowance for the influence [END]
of a strong passion at war with all interested motives [END]
mr knightley [END]
saw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its effects [END]
but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any [END]
hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest [END]
and more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very [END]
sure did not belong to mr elton [END]
harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers she came back [END]
not to think of mr martin but to talk of mr elton [END]
miss nash [END]
had been telling her something which she repeated immediately [END]
with great delight [END]
mr perry had been to mrs goddard's to attend [END]
a sick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash [END]
that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met [END]
mr elton and found to his great surprize that mr elton was [END]
actually on his road to london and not meaning to return till [END]
the morrow though it was the whist-club night which he had been [END]
never known to miss before and mr perry had remonstrated with him [END]
about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player [END]
to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off [END]
his journey only one day but it would not do mr elton had been [END]
determined to go on and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed [END]
that he was going on business which he would not put off for any [END]
inducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission [END]
and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious [END]
mr perry [END]
could not quite understand him but he was very sure there must [END]
be a _lady_ in the case and he told him so and mr elton only [END]
looked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits [END]
miss nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more [END]
about mr elton and said looking so very significantly at her [END]
that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be [END]
but she only knew that any woman whom mr elton could prefer [END]
she should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt [END]
mr elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness [END]
chapter ix [END]
mr knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel [END]
with herself [END]
he was so much displeased that it was longer than [END]
usual before he came to hartfield again and when they did meet [END]
his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven [END]
she was sorry [END]
but could not repent [END]
on the contrary her plans and proceedings [END]
were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general [END]
appearances of the next few days [END]
the picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after [END]
mr elton's return and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common [END]
sitting-room he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences [END]
of admiration just as he ought and as for harriet's feelings they were [END]
visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment [END]
as her youth and sort of mind admitted [END]
emma was soon perfectly [END]
satisfied of mr martin's being no otherwise remembered than as [END]
he furnished a contrast with mr elton of the utmost advantage to the latter [END]
her views of improving her little friend's mind by a great deal [END]
of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than [END]
a few first chapters and the intention of going on to-morrow [END]
it was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let [END]
her imagination range and work at harriet's fortune than to be [END]
labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts [END]
and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present [END]
the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life [END]
was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort [END]
that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper [END]
made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies [END]
in this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale [END]
are not uncommon [END]
miss nash head-teacher at mrs goddard's [END]
had written out at least three hundred and harriet who had taken [END]
the first hint of it from her hoped with miss woodhouse's help [END]
to get a great many more [END]
emma assisted with her invention [END]
memory and taste and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand [END]
it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form [END]
as well as quantity [END]
mr woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls [END]
and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in [END]
so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young he [END]
wondered he could not remember them [END]
but he hoped he should in time [END]
and it always ended in kitty a fair but frozen maid [END]
his good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject [END]
did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind [END]
but he had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about [END]
so much something he thought might come from that quarter [END]
it was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of [END]
highbury in general should be put under requisition [END]
mr elton [END]
was the only one whose assistance she asked [END]
he was invited [END]
to contribute any really good enigmas charades or conundrums [END]
that he might recollect and she had the pleasure of seeing him [END]
most intently at work with his recollections and at the same time [END]
as she could perceive most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant [END]
nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass [END]
his lips [END]
they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles [END]
and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled [END]
and rather sentimentally recited that well-known charade [END]
my first doth affliction denote [END]
which my second is destin'd to feel [END]
and my whole is the best antidote [END]
that affliction to soften and heal [END]
made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it [END]
some pages ago already [END]
why will not you write one yourself for us mr [END]
elton [END]
said she [END]
that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be [END]
easier to you [END]
oh no [END]
he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind [END]
in his life [END]
the stupidest fellow [END]
he was afraid not even miss [END]
woodhouse he stopt a moment or miss smith could inspire him [END]
the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration [END]
he called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the [END]
table containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had [END]
addressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which [END]
from his manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own [END]
i do not offer it for miss smith's collection said he [END]
being my friend's i have no right to expose it in any degree [END]
to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it [END]
the speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma [END]
could understand [END]
there was deep consciousness about him [END]
and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend's [END]
he was gone the next moment after another moment's pause [END]
take it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards [END]
harriet it is for you [END]
take your own [END]
but harriet was in a tremor and could not touch it and emma [END]
never loth to be first was obliged to examine it herself [END]
to miss [END]
charade [END]
my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings [END]
lords of the earth [END]
their luxury and ease [END]
another view of man my second brings [END]
behold him there the monarch of the seas [END]
but ah [END]
united what reverse we have [END]
man's boasted power and freedom all are flown [END]
lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave [END]
and woman lovely woman reigns alone [END]
thy ready wit the word will soon supply [END]
may its approval beam in that soft eye [END]
she cast her eye over it pondered caught the meaning read it through [END]
again to be quite certain and quite mistress of the lines and then [END]
passing it to harriet sat happily smiling and saying to herself [END]
while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion [END]
of hope and dulness very well mr elton very well indeed [END]
i have read worse charades [END]
_courtship_ a very good hint [END]
i give [END]
you credit for it [END]
this is feeling your way [END]
this is saying very [END]
plainly pray miss smith give me leave to pay my addresses to you [END]
approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance ' [END]
may its approval beam in that soft eye [END]
harriet exactly [END]
soft is the very word for her eye of all epithets [END]
the justest that could be given [END]
thy ready wit the word will soon supply [END]
humph harriet's ready wit [END]
all the better [END]
a man must be very much [END]
in love indeed to describe her so [END]
ah [END]
mr knightley i wish [END]
you had the benefit of this i think this would convince you [END]
for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken [END]
an excellent charade indeed [END]
and very much to the purpose [END]
things must come to a crisis soon now [END]
she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations [END]
which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the [END]
eagerness of harriet's wondering questions [END]
what can it be miss woodhouse what can it be [END]
i have not an idea i [END]
cannot guess it in the least [END]
what can it possibly be [END]
do try [END]
to find it out miss woodhouse [END]
do help me [END]
i never saw any thing [END]
so hard [END]
is it kingdom [END]
i wonder who the friend was and who could [END]
be the young lady [END]
do you think it is a good one [END]
can it be woman [END]
and woman lovely woman reigns alone [END]
can it be neptune [END]
behold him there the monarch of the seas [END]
or a trident [END]
or a mermaid [END]
or a shark [END]
oh no [END]
shark is only [END]
one syllable [END]
it must be very clever or he would not have brought it [END]
oh [END]
miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out [END]
mermaids and sharks [END]
nonsense [END]
my dear harriet what are you [END]
thinking of [END]
where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made [END]
by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark [END]
give me the paper and listen [END]
for miss read miss smith [END]
my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings [END]
lords of the earth [END]
their luxury and ease [END]
that is _court_ [END]
another view of man my second brings [END]
behold him there the monarch of the seas [END]
that is _ship_ plain as it can be now for the cream [END]
but ah [END]
united _courtship_ you know what reverse we have [END]
man's boasted power and freedom all are flown [END]
lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave [END]
and woman lovely woman reigns alone [END]
a very proper compliment and then follows the application [END]
which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty [END]
in comprehending [END]
read it in comfort to yourself [END]
there can [END]
be no doubt of its being written for you and to you [END]
harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion [END]
she read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness [END]
she could not speak [END]
but she was not wanted to speak [END]
it was enough [END]
for her to feel [END]
emma spoke for her [END]
there is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment [END]
said she that i cannot have a doubt as to mr elton's intentions [END]
you are his object and you will soon receive the completest proof [END]
of it [END]
i thought it must be so [END]
i thought i could not be so deceived [END]
but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided [END]
as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you [END]
yes harriet just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance [END]
to happen what has happened [END]
i could never tell whether an attachment [END]
between you and mr elton were most desirable or most natural [END]
its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each [END]
other [END]
i am very happy [END]
i congratulate you my dear harriet with all [END]
my heart [END]
this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride [END]
in creating [END]
this is a connexion which offers nothing but good [END]
it will give you every thing that you want consideration independence [END]
a proper home it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends [END]
close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever [END]
this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either [END]
of us [END]
dear miss woodhouse [END]
and dear miss woodhouse was all that harriet [END]
with many tender embraces could articulate at first but when they [END]
did arrive at something more like conversation it was sufficiently [END]
clear to her friend that she saw felt anticipated and remembered [END]
just as she ought [END]
mr elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment [END]
whatever you say is always right cried harriet and therefore [END]
i suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise i could [END]
not have imagined it [END]
it is so much beyond any thing i deserve [END]
mr elton who might marry any body [END]
there cannot be two opinions [END]
about _him_ [END]
he is so very superior [END]
only think of those sweet [END]
verses to miss ' [END]
dear me how clever could it really [END]
be meant for me [END]
i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that [END]
it is a certainty [END]
receive it on my judgment [END]
it is a sort [END]
of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon [END]
followed by matter-of-fact prose [END]
it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected [END]
i am sure [END]
a month ago i had no more idea myself the strangest things do [END]
take place [END]
when miss smiths and mr eltons get acquainted they do indeed and [END]
really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is [END]
so evidently so palpably desirable what courts the pre-arrangement [END]
of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form [END]
you and mr elton are by situation called together you belong [END]
to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes [END]
your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls [END]
there does [END]
seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love [END]
exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel [END]
where it ought to flow [END]
the course of true love never did run smooth [END]
a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage [END]
that mr elton should really be in love with me me of all people [END]
who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas [END]
and he [END]
the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body [END]
looks up to quite like mr knightley [END]
his company so sought after [END]
that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he [END]
does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days [END]
in the week [END]
and so excellent in the church [END]
miss nash has put down [END]
all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury [END]
dear me [END]
when i look back to the first time i saw him [END]
how little [END]
did i think the two abbots and i ran into the front room and [END]
peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss [END]
nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself [END]
however she called me back presently and let me look too [END]
which was very good-natured [END]
and how beautiful we thought he looked [END]
he was arm-in-arm with mr [END]
cole [END]
this is an alliance which whoever whatever your friends may be [END]
must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense [END]
and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools [END]
if they [END]
are anxious to see you _happily_ married here is a man whose amiable [END]
character gives every assurance of it if they wish to have you [END]
settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen [END]
to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only [END]
object is that you should in the common phrase be _well_ married [END]
here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment [END]
the rise in the world which must satisfy them [END]
yes very true [END]
how nicely you talk i love to hear you [END]
you understand every thing [END]
you and mr elton are one as clever [END]
as the other [END]
this charade if i had studied a twelvemonth [END]
i could never have made any thing like it [END]
i thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining [END]
it yesterday [END]
i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read [END]
i never read one more to the purpose certainly [END]
it is as long again as almost all we have had before [END]
i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour [END]
such things in general cannot be too short [END]
harriet was too intent on the lines to hear [END]
the most satisfactory [END]
comparisons were rising in her mind [END]
it is one thing said she presently her cheeks in a glow to [END]
have very good sense in a common way like every body else [END]
and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter [END]
and say just what you must in a short way and another to write [END]
verses and charades like this [END]
emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr martin's prose [END]
such sweet lines [END]
continued harriet these two last but [END]
how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found [END]
it out oh [END]
miss woodhouse what can we do about that [END]
leave it to me [END]
you do nothing [END]
he will be here this evening [END]
i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense [END]
or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed your [END]
soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming [END]
trust to me [END]
oh [END]
miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful [END]
charade into my book [END]
i am sure i have not got one half so good [END]
leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you [END]
should not write it into your book [END]
oh [END]
but those two lines are [END]
the best of all [END]
granted for private enjoyment and for private [END]
enjoyment keep them [END]
they are not at all the less written you know [END]
because you divide them [END]
the couplet does not cease to be nor does [END]
its meaning change [END]
but take it away and all _appropriation_ ceases [END]
and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection [END]
depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted [END]
much better than his passion [END]
a poet in love must be encouraged in [END]
both capacities or neither [END]
give me the book i will write it down [END]
and then there can be no possible reflection on you [END]
harriet submitted though her mind could hardly separate the parts [END]
so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down [END]
a declaration of love [END]
it seemed too precious an offering for any [END]
degree of publicity [END]
i shall never let that book go out of my own hands said she [END]
very well replied emma a most natural feeling and the longer [END]
it lasts the better i shall be pleased [END]
but here is my father [END]
coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him [END]
it will be giving him so much pleasure [END]
he loves any thing of [END]
the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment [END]
he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all you must [END]
let me read it to him [END]
harriet looked grave [END]
my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this [END]
charade you will betray your feelings improperly if you are [END]
too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning [END]
or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it [END]
do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration [END]
if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper [END]
while i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you [END]
do not let us be too solemn on the business [END]
he has encouragement [END]
enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade [END]
oh [END]
no i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it [END]
do as you please [END]
mr woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again [END]
by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of well my dears [END]
how does your book go on have you got any thing fresh [END]
yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh [END]
a piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt [END]
we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we [END]
have just copied it in [END]
she read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read [END]
slowly and distinctly and two or three times over with explanations [END]
of every part as she proceeded and he was very much pleased and [END]
as she had foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion [END]
aye that's very just indeed that's very properly said [END]
very true [END]
woman lovely woman ' [END]
it is such a pretty charade [END]
my dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought it nobody [END]
could have written so prettily but you emma [END]
emma only nodded and smiled after a little thinking [END]
and a very tender sigh he added [END]
ah [END]
it is no difficulty to see who you take after [END]
your dear mother [END]
was so clever at all those things [END]
if i had but her memory [END]
but i [END]
can remember nothing not even that particular riddle which you [END]
have heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza [END]
and there are several [END]
kitty a fair but frozen maid [END]
kindled a flame i yet deplore [END]
the hood-wink'd boy i called to aid [END]
though of his near approach afraid [END]
so fatal to my suit before [END]
and that is all that i can recollect of it but it is very clever [END]
all the way through [END]
but i think my dear you said you had got it [END]
yes papa it is written out in our second page [END]
we copied it [END]
from the elegant extracts [END]
it was garrick's you know [END]
aye very true i wish i could recollect more of it [END]
kitty a fair but frozen maid [END]
the name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near [END]
being christened catherine after her grandmama [END]
i hope we shall [END]
have her here next week [END]
have you thought my dear where you [END]
shall put her and what room there will be for the children [END]
oh [END]
yes she will have her own room of course the room she always [END]
has and there is the nursery for the children just as usual [END]
you know [END]
why should there be any change [END]
i do not know my dear but it is so long since she was here not [END]
since last easter and then only for a few days mr [END]
john knightley's [END]
being a lawyer is very inconvenient poor isabella she is sadly [END]
taken away from us all and how sorry she will be when she comes [END]
not to see miss taylor here [END]
she will not be surprized papa at least [END]
i do not know my dear [END]
i am sure i was very much surprized [END]
when i first heard she was going to be married [END]
we must ask mr and mrs weston to dine with us while isabella [END]
is here [END]
yes my dear if there is time but in a very depressed tone she [END]
is coming for only one week [END]
there will not be time for any thing [END]
it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer but it seems a case [END]
of necessity [END]
mr john knightley must be in town again on the 28th [END]
and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole [END]
of the time they can give to the country that two or three days [END]
are not to be taken out for the abbey [END]
mr knightley promises [END]
to give up his claim this christmas though you know it is longer [END]
since they were with him than with us [END]
it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were [END]
to be anywhere but at hartfield [END]
mr woodhouse could never allow for mr knightley's claims on [END]
his brother or any body's claims on isabella except his own [END]
he sat musing a little while and then said [END]
but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back [END]
so soon though he does [END]
i think emma i shall try and persuade [END]
her to stay longer with us [END]
she and the children might stay very well [END]
ah [END]
papa that is what you never have been able to accomplish [END]
and i do not think you ever will [END]
isabella cannot bear to stay [END]
behind her husband [END]
this was too true for contradiction [END]
unwelcome as it was mr woodhouse [END]
could only give a submissive sigh and as emma saw his spirits [END]
affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband [END]
she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them [END]
harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while [END]
my brother and sister are here [END]
i am sure she will be pleased [END]
with the children [END]
we are very proud of the children are not we [END]
papa [END]
i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john [END]
aye i wonder which she will [END]
poor little dears how glad they [END]
will be to come [END]
they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet [END]
i dare say they are sir [END]
i am sure i do not know who is not [END]
henry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama [END]
henry is the eldest [END]
he was named after me not after his father [END]
john the second [END]
is named after his father [END]
some people are surprized i believe [END]
that the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry [END]
which i thought very pretty of her [END]
and he is a very clever boy [END]
indeed [END]
they are all remarkably clever and they have so many [END]
pretty ways [END]
they will come and stand by my chair and say [END]
grandpapa can you give me a bit of string ' [END]
and once henry asked me [END]
for a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas [END]
i think their father is too rough with them very often [END]
he appears rough to you said emma because you are so very [END]
gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas [END]
you would not think him rough [END]
he wishes his boys to be active and hardy [END]
and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then [END]
but he is an affectionate father certainly mr john knightley [END]
is an affectionate father [END]
the children are all fond of him [END]
and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling [END]
in a very frightful way [END]
but they like it papa there is nothing they like so much [END]
it is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down [END]
the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way [END]
to the other [END]
well i cannot understand it [END]
that is the case with us all papa [END]
one half of the world cannot [END]
understand the pleasures of the other [END]
later in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate [END]
in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner the hero [END]
of this inimitable charade walked in again [END]
harriet turned away [END]
but emma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye [END]
soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push of [END]
having thrown a die and she imagined he was come to see how it [END]
might turn up [END]
his ostensible reason however was to ask whether [END]
mr woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening without him [END]
or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield [END]
if he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend [END]
cole had been saying so much about his dining with him had made [END]
such a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come [END]
emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his [END]
friend on their account her father was sure of his rubber [END]
he re-urged she re-declined and he seemed then about to make [END]
his bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it [END]
oh [END]
here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us [END]
thank you for the sight of it [END]
we admired it so much that i have [END]
ventured to write it into miss smith's collection [END]
your friend [END]
will not take it amiss i hope [END]
of course i have not transcribed [END]
beyond the first eight lines [END]
mr elton certainly did not very well know what to say [END]
he looked rather doubtingly rather confused said something about [END]
honour glanced at emma and at harriet and then seeing the book [END]
open on the table took it up and examined it very attentively [END]
with the view of passing off an awkward moment emma smilingly said [END]
you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade [END]
must not be confined to one or two [END]
he may be sure of every woman's [END]
approbation while he writes with such gallantry [END]
i have no hesitation in saying replied mr elton though hesitating [END]
a good deal while he spoke i have no hesitation in saying at [END]
least if my friend feels at all as _i_ do i have not the smallest [END]
doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as _i_ see it [END]
looking at the book again and replacing it on the table he [END]
would consider it as the proudest moment of his life [END]
after this speech he was gone as soon as possible [END]
emma could not [END]
think it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities [END]
there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt [END]
to incline her to laugh [END]
she ran away to indulge the inclination [END]
leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet's share [END]
chapter x [END]
though now the middle of december there had yet been no weather [END]
to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise [END]
and on the morrow emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor [END]
sick family who lived a little way out of highbury [END]
their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane a lane [END]
leading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street [END]
of the place and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode [END]
of mr elton [END]
a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed [END]
and then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage [END]
an old and not very good house almost as close to the road as it [END]
could be [END]
it had no advantage of situation but had been very much [END]
smartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was [END]
there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without [END]
a slackened pace and observing eyes emma's remark was [END]
there it is [END]
there go you and your riddle-book one of these days [END]
harriet's was [END]
oh what a sweet house how very beautiful there are the yellow [END]
curtains that miss nash admires so much [END]
i do not often walk this way _now_ said emma as they proceeded [END]
but _then_ there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get [END]
intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards [END]
of this part of highbury [END]
harriet she found had never in her life been within side the vicarage [END]
and her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors [END]
and probabilities emma could only class it as a proof of love [END]
with mr elton's seeing ready wit in her [END]
i wish we could contrive it said she but i cannot think [END]
of any tolerable pretence for going in no servant that i want [END]
to inquire about of his housekeeper no message from my father [END]
she pondered but could think of nothing [END]
after a mutual silence [END]
of some minutes harriet thus began again [END]
i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married [END]
or going to be married [END]
so charming as you are [END]
emma laughed and replied [END]
my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry [END]
i must find other people charming one other person at least [END]
and i am not only not going to be married at present but have [END]
very little intention of ever marrying at all [END]
ah so you say but i cannot believe it [END]
i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet [END]
to be tempted mr elton you know recollecting herself [END]
is out of the question and i do _not_ wish to see any such person [END]
i would rather not be tempted [END]
i cannot really change for the better [END]
if i were to marry i must expect to repent it [END]
dear me it is so odd to hear a woman talk so [END]
i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry [END]
were i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing [END]
but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature [END]
and i do not think i ever shall [END]
and without love i am sure i [END]
should be a fool to change such a situation as mine [END]
fortune i [END]
do not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want [END]
i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their [END]
husband's house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect [END]
to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always [END]
right in any man's eyes as i am in my father's [END]
but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates [END]
that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i [END]
thought i should ever be like miss bates [END]
so silly so satisfied [END]
so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing and unfastidious [END]
and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me [END]
i would marry to-morrow [END]
but between _us_ i am convinced there never [END]
can be any likeness except in being unmarried [END]
but still you will be an old maid [END]
and that's so dreadful [END]
never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is [END]
poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public [END]
a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous [END]
disagreeable old maid [END]
the proper sport of boys and girls [END]
but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable [END]
and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else [END]
and the [END]
distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common [END]
sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income [END]
has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper [END]
those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small [END]
and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross [END]
this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good [END]
natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very [END]
much to the taste of every body though single and though poor [END]
poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe [END]
if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely [END]
to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a [END]
great charm [END]
dear me [END]
but what shall you do [END]
how shall you employ yourself [END]
when you grow old [END]
if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great [END]
many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be [END]
more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty [END]
woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then [END]
as they are now or with no important variation [END]
if i draw less [END]
i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpet-work [END]
and as for objects of interest objects for the affections [END]
which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which [END]
is really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying i shall [END]
be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much [END]
to care about [END]
there will be enough of them in all probability [END]
to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need [END]
there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my [END]
attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas [END]
of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder [END]
my nephews [END]
and nieces i shall often have a niece with me [END]
do you know miss bates's niece [END]
that is i know you must have [END]
seen her a hundred times but are you acquainted [END]
oh [END]
yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes [END]
to highbury [END]
by the bye _that_ is almost enough to put one out [END]
of conceit with a niece [END]
heaven forbid [END]
at least that i should [END]
ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together [END]
as she does about jane fairfax [END]
one is sick of the very name [END]
of jane fairfax [END]
every letter from her is read forty times over [END]
her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she [END]
does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair [END]
of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month [END]
i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death [END]
they were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics [END]
were superseded [END]
emma was very compassionate and the distresses [END]
of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention [END]
and kindness her counsel and her patience as from her purse [END]
she understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and [END]
their temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary [END]
virtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into [END]
their troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance [END]
with as much intelligence as good-will [END]
in the present instance [END]
it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit [END]
and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice [END]
she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene [END]
as made her say to harriet as they walked away [END]
these are the sights harriet to do one good [END]
how trifling they [END]
make every thing else appear i feel now as if i could think of [END]
nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet [END]
who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind [END]
very true said harriet [END]
poor creatures [END]
one can think [END]
of nothing else [END]
and really i do not think the impression will soon be over [END]
said emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep [END]
which ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden [END]
and brought them into the lane again [END]
i do not think it will [END]
stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place [END]
and recall the still greater within [END]
oh [END]
dear no said her companion [END]
they walked on [END]
the lane made a slight bend and when that bend [END]
was passed mr elton was immediately in sight and so near [END]
as to give emma time only to say farther [END]
ah [END]
harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability [END]
in good thoughts [END]
well smiling i hope it may be allowed that [END]
if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers [END]
it has done all that is truly important [END]
if we feel for the wretched [END]
enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy [END]
only distressing to ourselves [END]
harriet could just answer oh [END]
dear yes before the gentleman [END]
joined them [END]
the wants and sufferings of the poor family however [END]
were the first subject on meeting [END]
he had been going to call [END]
on them [END]
his visit he would now defer but they had a very [END]
interesting parley about what could be done and should be done [END]
mr elton then turned back to accompany them [END]
to fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma [END]
to meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase [END]
of love on each side [END]
i should not wonder if it were to bring [END]
on the declaration [END]
it must if i were not here [END]
i wish i were [END]
anywhere else [END]
anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon [END]
afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised [END]
on one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road [END]
but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriet's [END]
habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that [END]
in short they would both be soon after her [END]
this would not do [END]
she immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration [END]
to make in the lacing of her half-boot and stooping down in complete [END]
occupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on [END]
and she would follow in half a minute [END]
they did as they were desired [END]
and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot [END]
she had the comfort of farther delay in her power being overtaken [END]
by a child from the cottage setting out according to orders [END]
with her pitcher to fetch broth from hartfield [END]
to walk by the side [END]
of this child and talk to and question her was the most natural [END]
thing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been [END]
acting just then without design and by this means the others were [END]
still able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her [END]
she gained on them however involuntarily the child's pace was quick [END]
and theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it [END]
from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them [END]
mr elton was speaking with animation harriet listening with a very [END]
pleased attention and emma having sent the child on was beginning [END]
to think how she might draw back a little more when they both [END]
looked around and she was obliged to join them [END]
mr elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail [END]
and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he [END]
was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's [END]
party at his friend cole's and that she was come in herself for [END]
the stilton cheese the north wiltshire the butter the cellery [END]
the beet-root and all the dessert [END]
this would soon have led to something better of course was her [END]
consoling reflection any thing interests between those who love [END]
and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart [END]
if i could but have kept longer away [END]
they now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage [END]
pales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into [END]
the house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot [END]
and fall behind to arrange it once more [END]
she then broke the lace [END]
off short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently [END]
obliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to [END]
put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort [END]
part of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am [END]
to contrive [END]
i really am a most troublesome companion to you both [END]
but i hope i am not often so ill-equipped [END]
mr elton i must beg [END]
leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit [END]
of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on [END]
mr elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing [END]
could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into [END]
his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage [END]
the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied [END]
and looking forwards behind it was another with which it immediately [END]
communicated the door between them was open and emma passed [END]
into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most [END]
comfortable manner [END]
she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she [END]
found it but she fully intended that mr elton should close it [END]
it was not closed however it still remained ajar but by engaging [END]
the housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make it [END]
practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room [END]
for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself [END]
it could [END]
be protracted no longer [END]
she was then obliged to be finished [END]
and make her appearance [END]
the lovers were standing together at one of the windows [END]
it had a [END]
most favourable aspect and for half a minute emma felt the glory [END]
of having schemed successfully [END]
but it would not do he had not [END]
come to the point [END]
he had been most agreeable most delightful [END]
he had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely [END]
followed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt [END]
but nothing serious [END]
cautious very cautious thought emma he advances inch by inch [END]
and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure [END]
still however though every thing had not been accomplished [END]
by her ingenious device she could not but flatter herself [END]
that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both [END]
and must be leading them forward to the great event [END]
chapter xi [END]
mr elton must now be left to himself [END]
it was no longer in emma's [END]
power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures [END]
the coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand [END]
that first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth [END]
her prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay [END]
at hartfield it was not to be expected she did not herself expect [END]
that any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could [END]
be afforded by her to the lovers [END]
they might advance rapidly [END]
if they would however they must advance somehow or other whether [END]
they would or no [END]
she hardly wished to have more leisure for them [END]
there are people who the more you do for them the less they will [END]
do for themselves [END]
mr and mrs john knightley from having been longer than usual [END]
absent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the [END]
usual interest [END]
till this year every long vacation since their [END]
marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey [END]
but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing [END]
for the children and it was therefore many months since they had [END]
been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions or seen at all [END]
by mr woodhouse who could not be induced to get so far as london [END]
even for poor isabella's sake and who consequently was now most [END]
nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit [END]
he thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a [END]
little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to [END]
bring some of the party the last half of the way but his alarms [END]
were needless the sixteen miles being happily accomplished [END]
and mr and mrs john knightley their five children and a competent [END]
number of nursery-maids all reaching hartfield in safety [END]
the bustle and joy of such an arrival the many to be talked to [END]
welcomed encouraged and variously dispersed and disposed of [END]
produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne [END]
under any other cause nor have endured much longer even for this [END]
but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were [END]
so respected by mrs john knightley that in spite of maternal [END]
solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones [END]
and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance [END]
all the eating and drinking and sleeping and playing [END]
which they could possibly wish for without the smallest delay [END]
the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him [END]
either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them [END]
mrs john knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle [END]
quiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate [END]
