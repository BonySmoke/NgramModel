barn [END]
last night of all [END]
when yond same starre that's westward from the pole [END]
had made his course t' illume that part of heauen [END]
where now it burnes marcellus and my selfe [END]
the bell then beating one [END]
mar [END]
peace breake thee of [END]

barn [END]
it would be spoke too [END]
mar [END]
question it horatio [END]
hor [END]

together with that faire and warlike forme [END]
in which the maiesty of buried denmarke [END]
did sometimes march by heauen i charge thee speake [END]

how now horatio [END]
you tremble look pale [END]
is not this something more then fantasie [END]
what thinke you on't [END]
hor [END]
before my god i might not this beleeue [END]
without the sensible and true auouch [END]
of mine owne eyes [END]
mar [END]
is it not like the king [END]
hor [END]
as thou art to thy selfe [END]
such was the very armour he had on [END]
when th' ambitious norwey combatted [END]
so frown'd he once when in an angry parle [END]
he smot the sledded pollax on the ice [END]
'tis strange [END]
mar [END]
thus twice before and iust at this dead houre [END]
with martiall stalke hath he gone by our watch [END]
hor [END]
in what particular thought to work i know not [END]
but in the grosse and scope of my opinion [END]
this boades some strange erruption to our state [END]
mar [END]
good now sit downe tell me he that knowes [END]
why this same strict and most obseruant watch [END]
so nightly toyles the subiect of the land [END]
and why such dayly cast of brazon cannon [END]
and forraigne mart for implements of warre [END]
why such impresse of ship-wrights whose sore taske [END]
do's not diuide the sunday from the weeke [END]
what might be toward that this sweaty hast [END]
doth make the night ioynt-labourer with the day [END]
who is't that can informe me [END]
hor [END]
that can i [END]
at least the whisper goes so our last king [END]
whose image euen but now appear'd to vs [END]
was as you know by fortinbras of norway [END]
thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride [END]
dar'd to the combate [END]
in which our valiant hamlet [END]
for so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him [END]
did slay this fortinbras who by a seal'd compact [END]
well ratified by law and heraldrie [END]
did forfeite with his life all those his lands [END]
which he stood seiz'd on to the conqueror [END]
against the which a moity competent [END]
was gaged by our king which had return'd [END]
to the inheritance of fortinbras [END]
had he bin vanquisher as by the same cou'nant [END]
and carriage of the article designe [END]
his fell to hamlet [END]
now sir young fortinbras [END]
of vnimproued mettle hot and full [END]
hath in the skirts of norway heere and there [END]
shark'd vp a list of landlesse resolutes [END]
for foode and diet to some enterprize [END]
that hath a stomacke in't which is no other [END]
and it doth well appeare vnto our state [END]
but to recouer of vs by strong hand [END]
and termes compulsatiue those foresaid lands [END]
so by his father lost and this i take it [END]
is the maine motiue of our preparations [END]
the sourse of this our watch and the cheefe head [END]
of this post-hast and romage in the land [END]
enter ghost againe [END]
but soft behold loe where it comes againe [END]
ile crosse it though it blast me [END]
stay illusion [END]
if thou hast any sound or vse of voyce [END]
speake to me [END]
if there be any good thing to be done [END]
that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me [END]
if thou art priuy to thy countries fate [END]
which happily foreknowing may auoyd oh speake [END]
or if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life [END]
extorted treasure in the wombe of earth [END]
for which they say you spirits oft walke in death [END]
speake of it [END]
stay and speake [END]
stop it marcellus [END]
mar [END]
shall i strike at it with my partizan [END]
hor [END]
do if it will not stand [END]
barn [END]
'tis heere [END]
hor [END]
'tis heere [END]
mar [END]
'tis gone [END]
exit ghost [END]
we do it wrong being so maiesticall [END]
to offer it the shew of violence [END]
for it is as the ayre invulnerable [END]
and our vaine blowes malicious mockery [END]
barn [END]
it was about to speake when the cocke crew [END]
hor [END]
and then it started like a guilty thing [END]
vpon a fearfull summons [END]
i haue heard [END]
the cocke that is the trumpet to the day [END]
doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throate [END]
awake the god of day and at his warning [END]
whether in sea or fire in earth or ayre [END]
th' extrauagant and erring spirit hyes [END]
to his confine [END]
and of the truth heerein [END]
this present obiect made probation [END]
mar [END]
it faded on the crowing of the cocke [END]
some sayes that euer 'gainst that season comes [END]
wherein our sauiours birch is celebrated [END]
the bird of dawning singeth all night long [END]
and then they say no spirit can walke abroad [END]
the nights are wholsome then no planets strike [END]
no faiery talkes nor witch hath power to charme [END]
so hallow'd and so gracious is the time [END]
hor [END]
so haue i heard and do in part beleeue it [END]
but looke the morne in russet mantle clad [END]
walkes o're the dew of yon high easterne hill [END]
breake we our watch vp and by my aduice [END]
let vs impart what we haue seene to night [END]
vnto yong hamlet [END]
for vpon my life [END]
this spirit dumbe to vs will speake to him [END]
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it [END]
as needfull in our loues fitting our duty [END]
mar [END]
let do't i pray and i this morning know [END]
where we shall finde him most conueniently [END]
exeunt [END]
scena secunda [END]
enter claudius king of denmarke gertrude the queene hamlet [END]
polonius [END]
laertes and his sister ophelia lords attendant [END]
king [END]
though yet of hamlet our deere brothers death [END]
the memory be greene and that it vs befitted [END]
to beare our hearts in greefe and our whole kingdome [END]
to be contracted in one brow of woe [END]
yet so farre hath discretion fought with nature [END]
that we with wisest sorrow thinke on him [END]
together with remembrance of our selues [END]
therefore our sometimes sister now our queene [END]
th' imperiall ioyntresse of this warlike state [END]
haue we as 'twere with a defeated ioy [END]
with one auspicious and one dropping eye [END]
with mirth in funerall and with dirge in marriage [END]
in equall scale weighing delight and dole [END]
taken to wife nor haue we heerein barr'd [END]
your better wisedomes which haue freely gone [END]
with this affaire along for all our thankes [END]
now followes that you know young fortinbras [END]
holding a weake supposall of our worth [END]
or thinking by our late deere brothers death [END]
our state to be disioynt and out of frame [END]
colleagued with the dreame of his aduantage [END]
he hath not fayl'd to pester vs with message [END]
importing the surrender of those lands [END]
lost by his father with all bonds of law [END]
to our most valiant brother [END]
so much for him [END]
enter voltemand and cornelius [END]
now for our selfe and for this time of meeting [END]
thus much the businesse is [END]
we haue heere writ [END]
to norway vncle of young fortinbras [END]
who impotent and bedrid scarsely heares [END]
of this his nephewes purpose to suppresse [END]
his further gate heerein [END]
in that the leuies [END]
the lists and full proportions are all made [END]
out of his subiect and we heere dispatch [END]
you good cornelius and you voltemand [END]
for bearing of this greeting to old norway [END]
giuing to you no further personall power [END]
to businesse with the king more then the scope [END]
of these dilated articles allow [END]
farewell and let your hast commend your duty [END]
volt [END]
in that and all things will we shew our duty [END]
king [END]
we doubt it nothing heartily farewell [END]
exit voltemand and cornelius [END]
and now laertes what's the newes with you [END]
you told vs of some suite [END]
what is't laertes [END]
you cannot speake of reason to the dane [END]
and loose your voyce [END]
what would'st thou beg laertes [END]
that shall not be my offer not thy asking [END]
the head is not more natiue to the heart [END]
the hand more instrumentall to the mouth [END]
then is the throne of denmarke to thy father [END]
what would'st thou haue laertes [END]
laer [END]
dread my lord [END]
your leaue and fauour to returne to france [END]
from whence though willingly i came to denmarke [END]
to shew my duty in your coronation [END]
yet now i must confesse that duty done [END]
my thoughts and wishes bend againe towards france [END]
and bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon [END]
king [END]
haue you your fathers leaue [END]
what sayes pollonius [END]
pol [END]
he hath my lord [END]
i do beseech you giue him leaue to go [END]
king [END]
take thy faire houre laertes time be thine [END]
and thy best graces spend it at thy will [END]
but now my cosin hamlet and my sonne [END]
ham [END]
a little more then kin and lesse then kinde [END]
king [END]
how is it that the clouds still hang on you [END]
ham [END]
not so my lord i am too much i'th' sun [END]
queen [END]
good hamlet cast thy nightly colour off [END]
and let thine eye looke like a friend on denmarke [END]
do not for euer with thy veyled lids [END]
seeke for thy noble father in the dust [END]
thou know'st 'tis common all that liues must dye [END]
passing through nature to eternity [END]
ham [END]
i madam it is common [END]
queen [END]
if it be [END]
why seemes it so particular with thee [END]
ham [END]
seemes madam [END]
nay it is i know not seemes [END]
'tis not alone my inky cloake good mother [END]
nor customary suites of solemne blacke [END]
nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath [END]
no nor the fruitfull riuer in the eye [END]
nor the deiected hauiour of the visage [END]
together with all formes moods shewes of griefe [END]
that can denote me truly [END]
these indeed seeme [END]
for they are actions that a man might play [END]
but i haue that within which passeth show [END]
these but the trappings and the suites of woe [END]
king [END]
'tis sweet and commendable [END]
in your nature hamlet [END]
to giue these mourning duties to your father [END]
but you must know your father lost a father [END]
that father lost lost his and the suruiuer bound [END]
in filiall obligation for some terme [END]
to do obsequious sorrow [END]
but to perseuer [END]
in obstinate condolement is a course [END]
of impious stubbornnesse [END]
'tis vnmanly greefe [END]
it shewes a will most incorrect to heauen [END]
a heart vnfortified a minde impatient [END]
an vnderstanding simple and vnschool'd [END]
for what we know must be and is as common [END]
as any the most vulgar thing to sence [END]
why should we in our peeuish opposition [END]
take it to heart [END]
fye 'tis a fault to heauen [END]
a fault against the dead a fault to nature [END]
to reason most absurd whose common theame [END]
is death of fathers and who still hath cried [END]
from the first coarse till he that dyed to day [END]
this must be so [END]
we pray you throw to earth [END]
this vnpreuayling woe and thinke of vs [END]
as of a father for let the world take note [END]
you are the most immediate to our throne [END]
and with no lesse nobility of loue [END]
then that which deerest father beares his sonne [END]
do i impart towards you [END]
for your intent [END]
in going backe to schoole in wittenberg [END]
it is most retrograde to our desire [END]
and we beseech you bend you to remaine [END]
heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye [END]
our cheefest courtier cosin and our sonne [END]
qu [END]
let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet [END]
i prythee stay with vs go not to wittenberg [END]
ham [END]
i shall in all my best [END]
obey you madam [END]
king [END]
why 'tis a louing and a faire reply [END]
be as our selfe in denmarke [END]
madam come [END]
this gentle and vnforc'd accord of hamlet [END]
sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof [END]
no iocond health that denmarke drinkes to day [END]
but the great cannon to the clowds shall tell [END]
and the kings rouce the heauens shall bruite againe [END]
respeaking earthly thunder [END]
come away [END]
exeunt [END]
manet hamlet [END]
ham [END]
oh that this too too solid flesh would melt [END]
thaw and resolue it selfe into a dew [END]
or that the euerlasting had not fixt [END]
his cannon 'gainst selfe-slaughter [END]
o god o god [END]
how weary stale flat and vnprofitable [END]
seemes to me all the vses of this world [END]
fie on't [END]
oh fie fie 'tis an vnweeded garden [END]
that growes to seed things rank and grosse in nature [END]
possesse it meerely [END]
that it should come to this [END]
but two months dead nay not so much not two [END]
so excellent a king that was to this [END]
hiperion to a satyre so louing to my mother [END]
that he might not beteene the windes of heauen [END]
visit her face too roughly [END]
heauen and earth [END]
must i remember why she would hang on him [END]
as if encrease of appetite had growne [END]
by what is fed on and yet within a month [END]
let me not thinke on't frailty thy name is woman [END]
a little month or ere those shooes were old [END]
with which she followed my poore fathers body [END]
like niobe all teares [END]
why she euen she [END]
o heauen [END]
a beast that wants discourse of reason [END]
would haue mourn'd longer married with mine vnkle [END]
my fathers brother but no more like my father [END]
then i to hercules [END]
within a moneth [END]
ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous teares [END]
had left the flushing of her gauled eyes [END]
she married [END]
o most wicked speed to post [END]
with such dexterity to incestuous sheets [END]
it is not nor it cannot come to good [END]
but breake my heart for i must hold my tongue [END]
enter horatio barnardo and marcellus [END]

i would not haue your enemy say so [END]
nor shall you doe mine eare that violence [END]
to make it truster of your owne report [END]
against your selfe [END]
i know you are no truant [END]
but what is your affaire in elsenour [END]

hor [END]

with an attent eare till i may deliuer [END]
vpon the witnesse of these gentlemen [END]

for heauens loue let me heare [END]
hor [END]
two nights together had these gentlemen [END]
marcellus and barnardo on their watch [END]
in the dead wast and middle of the night [END]
beene thus encountred [END]
a figure like your father [END]
arm'd at all points exactly cap a pe [END]
appeares before them and with sollemne march [END]
goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkt [END]
by their opprest and feare-surprized eyes [END]
within his truncheons length whilst they bestil'd [END]
almost to ielly with the act of feare [END]
stand dumbe and speake not to him [END]
this to me [END]
in dreadfull secrecie impart they did [END]
and i with them the third night kept the watch [END]
whereas they had deliuer'd both in time [END]
forme of the thing each word made true and good [END]
the apparition comes [END]
i knew your father [END]
these hands are not more like [END]
ham [END]
but where was this [END]
mar [END]
my lord vpon the platforme where we watcht [END]
ham [END]
did you not speake to it [END]
hor [END]
my lord i did [END]
but answere made it none yet once me thought [END]
it lifted vp it head and did addresse [END]
it selfe to motion like as it would speake [END]
but euen then the morning cocke crew lowd [END]
and at the sound it shrunke in hast away [END]
and vanisht from our sight [END]
ham [END]
tis very strange [END]
hor [END]
as i doe liue my honourd lord 'tis true [END]
and we did thinke it writ downe in our duty [END]
to let you know of it [END]
ham [END]
indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me [END]
hold you the watch to night [END]
both [END]
we doe my lord [END]
ham [END]
arm'd say you [END]
both [END]
arm'd my lord [END]
ham [END]
from top to toe [END]
both [END]
my lord from head to foote [END]
ham [END]
then saw you not his face [END]
hor [END]
o yes my lord he wore his beauer vp [END]
ham [END]
what lookt he frowningly [END]
hor [END]
a countenance more in sorrow then in anger [END]
ham [END]
pale or red [END]
hor [END]
nay very pale [END]
ham [END]
and fixt his eyes vpon you [END]
hor [END]
most constantly [END]
ham [END]
i would i had beene there [END]
hor [END]
it would haue much amaz'd you [END]
ham [END]
very like very like staid it long [END]
hor [END]
while one with moderate hast might tell a hundred [END]
all [END]
longer longer [END]
hor [END]
not when i saw't [END]
ham [END]
his beard was grisly [END]
no [END]
hor [END]
it was as i haue seene it in his life [END]
a sable siluer'd [END]
ham [END]
ile watch to night perchance 'twill wake againe [END]
hor [END]
i warrant you it will [END]
ham [END]
if it assume my noble fathers person [END]
ile speake to it though hell it selfe should gape [END]
and bid me hold my peace [END]
i pray you all [END]
if you haue hitherto conceald this sight [END]
let it bee treble in your silence still [END]
and whatsoeuer els shall hap to night [END]
giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue [END]
i will requite your loues so fare ye well [END]
vpon the platforme twixt eleuen and twelue [END]

all [END]
our duty to your honour [END]
exeunt [END]
ham [END]
your loue as mine to you farewell [END]
my fathers spirit in armes [END]
all is not well [END]
i doubt some foule play would the night were come [END]
till then sit still my soule foule deeds will rise [END]
though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies [END]
enter [END]
scena tertia [END]
enter laertes and ophelia [END]
laer [END]
my necessaries are imbark't farewell [END]
and sister as the winds giue benefit [END]
and conuoy is assistant doe not sleepe [END]
but let me heare from you [END]
ophel [END]
doe you doubt that [END]
laer [END]
for hamlet and the trifling of his fauours [END]
hold it a fashion and a toy in bloude [END]
a violet in the youth of primy nature [END]
froward not permanent sweet not lasting [END]
the suppliance of a minute [END]
no more [END]
ophel [END]
no more but so [END]
laer [END]
thinke it no more [END]
for nature cressant does not grow alone [END]
in thewes and bulke but as his temple waxes [END]
the inward seruice of the minde and soule [END]
growes wide withall [END]
perhaps he loues you now [END]
and now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch [END]
the vertue of his feare but you must feare [END]
his greatnesse weigh'd his will is not his owne [END]
for hee himselfe is subiect to his birth [END]
hee may not as vnuallued persons doe [END]
carue for himselfe for on his choyce depends [END]
the sanctity and health of the whole state [END]
and therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd [END]
vnto the voyce and yeelding of that body [END]
whereof he is the head [END]
then if he sayes he loues you [END]
it fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it [END]
as he in his peculiar sect and force [END]
may giue his saying deed which is no further [END]
then the maine voyce of denmarke goes withall [END]
then weight what losse your honour may sustaine [END]
if with too credent eare you list his songs [END]
or lose your heart or your chast treasure open [END]
to his vnmastred importunity [END]
feare it ophelia feare it my deare sister [END]
and keepe within the reare of your affection [END]
out of the shot and danger of desire [END]
the chariest maid is prodigall enough [END]
if she vnmaske her beauty to the moone [END]
vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes [END]
the canker galls the infants of the spring [END]
too oft before the buttons be disclos'd [END]
and in the morne and liquid dew of youth [END]
contagious blastments are most imminent [END]
be wary then best safety lies in feare [END]
youth to it selfe rebels though none else neere [END]
ophe [END]
i shall th' effect of this good lesson keepe [END]
as watchmen to my heart but good my brother [END]

with what in the name of heauen [END]
ophe [END]
my lord as i was sowing in my chamber [END]
lord hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac'd [END]
no hat vpon his head his stockings foul'd [END]
vngartred and downe giued to his anckle [END]
pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other [END]
and with a looke so pitious in purport [END]
as if he had been loosed out of hell [END]
to speake of horrors he comes before me [END]
polon [END]
mad for thy loue [END]
ophe [END]
my lord i doe not know but truly i do feare it [END]
polon [END]
what said he [END]
ophe [END]
he tooke me by the wrist and held me hard [END]
then goes he to the length of all his arme [END]
and with his other hand thus o're his brow [END]
he fals to such perusall of my face [END]
as he would draw it [END]
long staid he so [END]
at last a little shaking of mine arme [END]
and thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe [END]
he rais'd a sigh so pittious and profound [END]
that it did seeme to shatter all his bulke [END]
and end his being [END]
that done he lets me goe [END]
and with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd [END]
he seem'd to finde his way without his eyes [END]
for out adores he went without their helpe [END]
and to the last bended their light on me [END]
polon [END]
goe with me i will goe seeke the king [END]
this is the very extasie of loue [END]
whose violent property foredoes it selfe [END]
and leads the will to desperate vndertakings [END]
as oft as any passion vnder heauen [END]
that does afflict our natures [END]
i am sorrie [END]
what haue you giuen him any hard words of late [END]
ophe [END]
no my good lord but as you did command [END]
i did repell his letters and deny'de [END]
his accesse to me [END]
pol [END]
that hath made him mad [END]
i am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement [END]
i had not quoted him [END]
i feare he did but trifle [END]
and meant to wracke thee but beshrew my iealousie [END]
it seemes it is as proper to our age [END]
to cast beyond our selues in our opinions [END]
as it is common for the yonger sort [END]

if i had playd the deske or table-booke [END]
or giuen my heart a winking mute and dumbe [END]
or look'd vpon this loue with idle sight [END]

no i went round to worke [END]
and my yong mistris thus i did bespeake [END]
lord hamlet is a prince out of thy starre [END]
this must not be and then i precepts gaue her [END]
that she should locke her selfe from his resort [END]
admit no messengers receiue no tokens [END]
which done she tooke the fruites of my aduice [END]
and he repulsed [END]
a short tale to make [END]
fell into a sadnesse then into a fast [END]
thence to a watch thence into a weaknesse [END]
thence to a lightnesse and by this declension [END]
into the madnesse whereon now he raues [END]

truely and i hold ambition of so ayry and [END]
light a quality that it is but a shadowes shadow [END]

that this goodly frame the earth seemes to me a sterrill [END]
promontory this most excellent canopy the ayre [END]
look you this braue ore-hanging this maiesticall roofe [END]
fretted with golden fire why it appeares no other thing [END]
to mee then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours [END]

to be or not to be that is the question [END]
whether 'tis nobler in the minde to suffer [END]
the slings and arrowes of outragious fortune [END]
or to take armes against a sea of troubles [END]
and by opposing end them to dye to sleepe [END]
no more and by a sleepe to say we end [END]
the heart-ake and the thousand naturall shockes [END]
that flesh is heyre too [END]
'tis a consummation [END]
deuoutly to be wish'd [END]
to dye to sleepe [END]
to sleepe perchance to dreame i there's the rub [END]
for in that sleepe of death what dreames may come [END]
when we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile [END]
must giue vs pawse [END]
there's the respect [END]
that makes calamity of so long life [END]
for who would beare the whips and scornes of time [END]
the oppressors wrong the poore mans contumely [END]
the pangs of dispriz'd loue the lawes delay [END]
the insolence of office and the spurnes [END]
that patient merit of the vnworthy takes [END]
when he himselfe might his quietus make [END]
with a bare bodkin [END]
who would these fardles beare [END]
to grunt and sweat vnder a weary life [END]
but that the dread of something after death [END]
the vndiscouered countrey from whose borne [END]
no traueller returnes puzels the will [END]
and makes vs rather beare those illes we haue [END]
then flye to others that we know not of [END]
thus conscience does make cowards of vs all [END]
and thus the natiue hew of resolution [END]
is sicklied o're with the pale cast of thought [END]
and enterprizes of great pith and moment [END]
with this regard their currants turne away [END]
and loose the name of action [END]

we shall know by these fellowes the players [END]
cannot keepe counsell they'l tell all [END]
ophe [END]
will they tell vs what this shew meant [END]
ham [END]
i or any shew that you'l shew him [END]
bee not [END]
you asham'd to shew hee'l not shame to tell you what it [END]
meanes [END]
ophe [END]
you are naught you are naught ile marke the [END]
play [END]
enter prologue [END]
for vs and for our tragedie [END]
heere stooping to your clemencie [END]
we begge your hearing patientlie [END]
ham [END]
is this a prologue or the poesie of a ring [END]
ophe [END]
'tis briefe my lord [END]
ham [END]
as womans loue [END]
enter king and his queene [END]
king [END]
full thirtie times hath phoebus cart gon round [END]
neptunes salt wash and tellus orbed ground [END]
and thirtie dozen moones with borrowed sheene [END]
about the world haue times twelue thirties beene [END]
since loue our hearts and hymen did our hands [END]
vnite comutuall in most sacred bands [END]
bap [END]
so many iournies may the sunne and moone [END]
make vs againe count o're ere loue be done [END]
but woe is me you are so sicke of late [END]
so farre from cheere and from your former state [END]
that i distrust you yet though i distrust [END]
discomfort you my lord it nothing must [END]
for womens feare and loue holds quantitie [END]
in neither ought or in extremity [END]
now what my loue is proofe hath made you know [END]
and as my loue is siz'd my feare is so [END]
king [END]
faith i must leaue thee loue and shortly too [END]
my operant powers my functions leaue to do [END]
and thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde [END]
honour'd belou'd and haply one as kinde [END]
for husband shalt thou- [END]
bap [END]
oh confound the rest [END]
such loue must needs be treason in my brest [END]
in second husband let me be accurst [END]
none wed the second but who kill'd the first [END]
ham [END]
wormwood wormwood [END]
bapt [END]
the instances that second marriage moue [END]
are base respects of thrift but none of loue [END]
a second time i kill my husband dead [END]
when second husband kisses me in bed [END]
king [END]
i do beleeue you [END]
think what now you speak [END]
but what we do determine oft we breake [END]
purpose is but the slaue to memorie [END]
of violent birth but poore validitie [END]
which now like fruite vnripe stickes on the tree [END]
but fall vnshaken when they mellow bee [END]
most necessary 'tis that we forget [END]
to pay our selues what to our selues is debt [END]
what to our selues in passion we propose [END]
the passion ending doth the purpose lose [END]
the violence of other greefe or ioy [END]
their owne ennactors with themselues destroy [END]
where ioy most reuels greefe doth most lament [END]
greefe ioyes ioy greeues on slender accident [END]
this world is not for aye nor 'tis not strange [END]
that euen our loues should with our fortunes change [END]
for 'tis a question left vs yet to proue [END]
whether loue lead fortune or else fortune loue [END]
the great man downe you marke his fauourites flies [END]
the poore aduanc'd makes friends of enemies [END]
and hitherto doth loue on fortune tend [END]
for who not needs shall neuer lacke a frend [END]
and who in want a hollow friend doth try [END]
directly seasons him his enemie [END]
but orderly to end where i begun [END]
our willes and fates do so contrary run [END]
that our deuices still are ouerthrowne [END]
our thoughts are ours their ends none of our owne [END]
so thinke thou wilt no second husband wed [END]
but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead [END]
bap [END]
nor earth to giue me food nor heauen light [END]
sport and repose locke from me day and night [END]
each opposite that blankes the face of ioy [END]
meet what i would haue well and it destroy [END]
both heere and hence pursue me lasting strife [END]
if once a widdow euer i be wife [END]
ham [END]
if she should breake it now [END]
king [END]
'tis deepely sworne [END]
sweet leaue me heere a while [END]
my spirits grow dull and faine i would beguile [END]
the tedious day with sleepe [END]

warlicke appointment gaue vs chace [END]
finding our selues too [END]
slow of saile we put on a compelled valour [END]
in the grapple i [END]

that he which hath your noble father slaine [END]
pursued my life [END]

it well appeares [END]

why you proceeded not against these feates [END]
so crimefull and so capitall in nature [END]

king [END]
o for two speciall reasons [END]
which may to you perhaps seeme much vnsinnowed [END]
and yet to me they are strong [END]
the queen his mother [END]
liues almost by his lookes and for my selfe [END]
my vertue or my plague be it either which [END]
she's so coniunctiue to my life and soule [END]
that as the starre moues not but in his sphere [END]
i could not but by her [END]
the other motiue [END]
why to a publike count i might not go [END]
is the great loue the generall gender beare him [END]
who dipping all his faults in their affection [END]
would like the spring that turneth wood to stone [END]
conuert his gyues to graces [END]
so that my arrowes [END]
too slightly timbred for so loud a winde [END]
would haue reuerted to my bow againe [END]
and not where i had arm'd them [END]
laer [END]
and so haue i a noble father lost [END]
a sister driuen into desperate tearmes [END]
who was if praises may go backe againe [END]
stood challenger on mount of all the age [END]
for her perfections [END]
but my reuenge will come [END]

to an exployt now ripe in my deuice [END]
vnder the which he shall not choose but fall [END]

but euen his mother shall vncharge the practice [END]
and call it accident some two monthes hence [END]
here was a gentleman of normandy [END]

your sodaine comming ore to play with him [END]

why aske you this [END]
kin [END]
not that i thinke you did not loue your father [END]

let's further thinke of this [END]
weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes [END]

when downe the weedy trophies and her selfe [END]
fell in the weeping brooke her cloathes spred wide [END]
and mermaid-like a while they bore her vp [END]
which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes [END]
as one incapable of her owne distresse [END]
or like a creature natiue and indued [END]
